Or learning as in conscious effort?

I'd be pretty angry if a doctor told me this.

57    0.0      0 controls  I don't think we can unlearn pain imo because it's so deeply planted in humans. Maybe we can, but maybe not until we have another human evolution without a single human being experiencing pain in the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
60   -1.0      2 HCNoPain  We learn what pain means when we experience it, but unless we have amnesia we're not going to unlearn that experience.   Too many very questionable interpretations can be made of this statement. Once again, simplified to the point of meaninglessness.

68   -1.0      2 HCNoPain  I think the term 'learned' is often misunderstood in this context.  From my understanding this is related to neuroplastic changes that occur during all learning and adaptations.  This should not be communicated to patients in this way as it makes it sound like they are studying and trying to learn pain and all they have to do now is unlearn it.  However, I believe the concept of learned behaviours in pain is consistent with the literature I have read.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
77    0.0      2 HCNoPain  Not exactly a 'useless' statement, but not helpful in all cases or as a general rule. It doesn't take into account possible causes of pain. Not all pain is a result solely of a learned response. Sometimes there is something wrong in the body.

99   -1.0      1 patients  I understand this, but most won't. This is about neurons and pain pathways, which is really hard to understand. Is it possible for me to "unlearn" my pain from spinal disease? And how was it "learned" in the first place when I was unaware of what was really happening inside my own body? Because honestly, this statement is confusing and sounds like once again implying it's just psychological, right back to "it's all in your head." It feels like being told our pain simply isn't real. A better way of saying this would be to acknowledge our pain is real and then add that there are things we can learn to cope and manage said pain. It is unlikely for a pain patient to ever believe that their pain is a learned experience. Even my first reaction was somewhere along the lines of "Huh? WTF is that supposed to mean?" Then promptly followed by irritation.

123  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  Pain is in principle a protection and information mechanism. Our related reactions/behaviours are partial automatic, reflective (e.g. hitting onself on the thumb with a hammer - scream, blame the hammer, throw the hammer away, bring the thumb to the mouth, help seeking if pain does not subside etc.). Some protective behaviours become habitual, and they may become counterproductive overtime (avoidance behaviour; freeze reactions; imbalance between "rest-digest"phases)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
126   0.0      0 controls  I do believe pain is learned, it's more of a gradient. When you're a toddler and sustain a trauma, although  minor to an adult it is painful to the toddler. I believe pain is hardwired into our brains because it can be seen a safety mechanism (to get away from that which has altered the steady-state). The brain's sole purpose is to allow the organism to procure its food source and allow it to escape predators so that it may go on to reproduce. Taking out the cultural and social aspects of humans, we are animals at best with a more developed prefrontal cortex. nonetheless pain is hardwired into us. taking an analgesic can temporarily block  the pain signals  but given enough time the body will return to its steady-state. I'm not sure that pain can be unlearned and im more inclined to ask why anyone would want to unlearn it, given its value that  is has provided for thousands of years.

178  -1.0      3 HCPain    I disagree that pain is learned. We are all born with nociceptors that fire whether we know what pain is or not. Maybe they should be more specific.

199  -1.0      1 patients  I don't think you can unlearn pain. I think you can master it. It's not something you can simply forget, especially if it's omnipresent. But if you can accept it and learn to master your reactions, manage it by living the fullest life possible, you may have some relief and not allow pain to control your life.

Therefore, it should be possible to unlearn that, but I don't know how.

I think one can learn to feel pain less, for example through meditative practice, but they do not unlearn pain as such? They learn to cope while the pain remains.

It feels like being told its your fault you are in constant pain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
238  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  I struggle with this particular phrase because if you're not careful it can sound very much like blaming. Yes, our nervous system can learn pain in the same way at learns any other pattern, but this description must be used very carefully.Yes, our nervous system can learn pain in the same way it learns any other pattern, but this description must be used very carefully

241  -1.0      1 patients  While I understand the concept of reprogramming the system, this delivery is just rude.  It sounds like the next thing you're going to tell me is to drink more water and do more yoga.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
244  -1.0      3 HCPain    Overly simplistic and not true in many cases. Like saying 'what comes on it' s own will go away the same way too', as a reason not to seek assistance for pain or disease.

252  -1.0      1 patients  Fuck you. Sorry but seriously. I hate this phrasing. Makes it sound like we are causing it and can stop it at any time. You shoukd say there are tools we can teach you to unlearn your pain but even that sounds like bs and i don't believe it for a second. There are coping tools to learn to live with it not unlearn pain as if we are controlling it. If walk out of your office if u said this to me

262  -1.0      1 patients  It doesn't really help to just know that information, provided you accept it. Plus, from the extent of research I know of, you can't really completely "unlearn" fibromyalgia pain, you can only diminish it somewhat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
263  -1.0      1 patients  Pain in your nerves -can- become "expected" and your system can "feel" pain potentially even when it's not actually occurring.  It's part of the reason Neurostimulators work, it's confusing to your pain system and can substitute electrical activity with pain signals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
264  -1.0      1 patients  Like many chronic pain patients, I have spent YEARS trying to 'unlearn' my pain through many many therapies. I find this statement offensive and in my own case, inaccurate as I know there is literally nothing more I could have done to eliminate my own pain. The statement basically implies you can get rid of pain if you try hard enough and sadly I know this isn't always the case.

If you are trying to say it's our brain responding to body impulses, yes that's true and can be blocked, but unlearned only makes sense in psychosomatic way.

Also implies that being in pain is a choice, that if you're in pain, you just aren't trying hard enough to feel better.

If not, then it seems irrelevant to those dealing with the pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
320  -1.0      3 HCPain    I'm not sure what is meant by this statement but it seems to put the burden back on the patient and again invalidates their experience. Pain is learned??

321  -1.0      1 patients  Mind over matter is B.S. If I could just think my pain away don't you think I'd do that? If my fellow disabled EDS people could just wish or think themselves out of their wheelchairs, don't you think they would? What kind of crazy person makes the choice to be in pain. Ableist. Absolutely ridiculous.

338  -1.0      1 patients  Total bullshit. If that were true people would learn to stop feeling pain altogether, whenever they pleased. This is built off the idea people in chronic pain are weak/crazy and want to be in pain. That we're in pain because we're defective as a person, a stereotype. This is unscientific and I hear this the most from religious people.

343  -1.0      1 patients  I have two conditions that have caused and will continue to cause measurable damage. The presence of chronic pain is DIRECTLY related to these conditions. And it took 12 years for an accurate diagnosis - someone telling me "pain can be unlearned" is not helpful because I need legitimate treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
345  -1.0      1 patients  I'm trained in Applied Behavior Analysis and would be interested to learn how that could be true.  I've done literature reviews for behavioral interventions to decrease pain and there isn't much (despite that hypnosis has certainly proven to be effective for many people.)  It seems weird to say this.  Some pain can be unlearned seems much less ambiguous and confusing to me.

"Conditioned" would be less condescending and more precise.

Pain is a physiological response even when the brain is not reporting it accurately.

382  -1.0      1 patients  Even animals feel pain. Yes, you can walk off some injuries, but that doesn't mean that they stop hurting. Pain is an innate sensation. You can try to ignore it, but you cannot unlearn it, to my knowledge.

394   0.0      1 patients  I think that's far too simplistic.   There's different kinds of pain.   Some can be helped with a mindfulness approach or disassociation.

399  -1.0      1 patients  In rare, specific cases, this can be relevant, but I find this statement once again puts all of the responsibility on the pain patient.

A child violently yelling and crying about a paper cut will come to realize that in the greater scheme of things, a paper cut is superficial and can be dealt with adequately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
425  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  What sort of pain are we talking about? I find it difficult to believe that all pain is learned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
428  -1.0      1 patients  This statement requires more context for a judgment of its merits to be useful. I do however think it would benefit from clarification that it's not always consciously and intentionally learned. As the statement is presently worded, it does lean in tone toward blaming the patient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
430  -1.0      1 patients  If this is followed up with help to change a perception, great. However a suggestion to meditate more is not helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
434  -1.0      1 patients  I suffer frequent dislocations which stretch and damage tissue. I am extremely doubtful my body can "unlearn" that type of pain. I doubt a patient in pain with a fractured arm  would be told they just need to unlearn that pain instead of being given pain control during the acute injury phase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
440  -1.0      1 patients  I've learned to turn out the pain through meditation and mind programming. But beleiving that the pain can be 'unlearned' Is something that stems from extreme privilege by people who cannot even fathom the amounts of pain people can endure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
441  -1.0      1 patients  I don't see how this applies when there are obvious physical reasons for pain.

It is never a habit and the body always wants relief and to heal.

503  -1.0      1 patients  That's ridiculous. That's like telling an athlete with a broken leg to "walk it off".   Can you train yourself to ignore certain pain? Sure. Like going to work with back spasms. It definitely hurts, and the spasms aren't going away by themselves, but the work still needs to get done. But that's not the same as "unlearning" it.

508  -1.0      1 patients  What causes pain is learned. Pain itself is not learned, it is a physical response to external or internal stimuli. Telling someone experiencing pain that it can be unlearned, especially in cases where there is an underlying physical cause, is not only condescending, it has the potential to be emotionally and mentally damaging.

518  -1.0      1 patients  I am 100% not doing cognitive behavioral therapy nonsense. I would rather learn to ignore my pain on my own than shell out a lot of money to a therapist to deal with it. It's a complete waste of money. I have had a homophobic therapist before. I'll read cognitive behavioral therapy worksheets if I must do something. But I'm 100% not doing therapy. I'd rather pretend that I'm no longer in pain than deal with a therapist. It feels like I'm being blamed for my pain and if a doctor is going to do that then I'm just going to suffer through it and not bother. I'd rather just use a bunch of overlapping treatments for pain and suffer through. It sounds stubborn- and I am stubborn. Therapists aren't sufficiently evidence based for me, detrimental to the lgbt population, and I will solve it myself before participating in something that I view as detrimental to growth and progress.               
520  -1.0      1 patients  There are better ways to express this idea. By talking about pain as "bad learning," it implies that the patient's coping is the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
524   0.0      1 patients  This feels... complicated. Dealing with chronic pain often leaves you without a sense of control. Saying that you can unlearn it almost gives you a feeling of having given away that control, like somehow it's your own fault that you're in pain.

529  -1.0      1 patients  Pain is not learned, it is a function the body uses to protect us from harm.

548  -1.0      3 HCPain    What does that even mean? Pain is learned? Someone bashes you in the ribs and you "learn" that pain? And then when it happens again you can respond differently as you can "unlearn" it? That's really dumb.

575  -1.0      1 patients  The only way pain can be unlearned is to stop being in pain. Pain is the body telling the patient that something is wrong and needs to be fixed, forcing the patient to ignore their pain can only make the situation worse.

588  -1.0      1 patients  As someone whose nerves simply do not work. I really wish that just growing new nerves i.e. "unlearning the pain" was a viable treatment. I once asked the doctor if we burned all the nerve endings off would the new ones regrow without fibromyalgia, I believe the answer was no.

594  -1.0      1 patients  While I cannot speak for everyone, MY pain is not learned. Over the years, I have discovered a few activities that can help take my focus off the pain long enough for me to deal with it and get it back to a level I can work around. Things like mentally translating languages while correcting grammar can help *distract* from SOME of my pain if I notice the pain increasing in time, but it certainly does not STOP the pain or "unlearn" it.

You get tired faster, you can't think as well, you avoid things - even if you don't have 10/10 pain.

You can get used to a level of pain, but it can't be willed away.

641  -1.0      1 patients  I wish that was true. Yes tension makes it worse and years of your body doing that will make the pain worse. Unlearning it can help but when your body hurt all the amount of breathing exercises and work to tense won't completely take the pain away. It will help bit the pain is still real                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
643  -1.0      0 controls  How is pain "learned"? Do babies have to figure out how to experience pain? If we'd never learned pain, could we cut our limbs off without suffering that sensation at all? It's hard to see how this is not just a flat-our lie.

677  -1.0      1 patients  Pain is not learned. A newborn can feel pain.  Chronic pain patients will try anything for relief. If you had a real way to "unlearn" pain of course I will try it. But first I challenge you to go to the dentist and get a filling without novacaine because if you believe pain is imagined then put your philosophy to the test.

683  -1.0      1 patients  Do they mean the pain itself, or what causes the pain? Like if someone has poor posture causing them pain, the poor posture can be unlearned.

706   0.0      1 patients  This could be encouraging or alienating depending on the person and context. Because of its simplicity it could end up looking like that "mind over matter" type platitude you hear from people who do not suffer from chronic pain. It's the equivalent of that well-meaning but very frustrating "Just do yoga and go to bed on time and your depression will be cured!" mentality. It's worth noting also that merely pointing out that a thing is possible is not the same as teaching someone how to do it. However, if it comes along with an explanation of how pain is learned in the first place and proof/examples of people who have unlearned pain, it could be very, very encouraging.

715  -1.0      1 patients  I cannot express myself on this. I don't think that pain can be un-learned. Pain is something I feel in response to certain stimuli. It just happens in the same way my eyes fill with tears if a fly goes in or in the same way my leg springs up if a doctor hits my knee.  It is not something my body learned to do: it is how it reacts under specific conditions.  I hope that pain can be eliminated by changing certain conditions of my body (nerve inflammation?) I don't quite understand how pain could be un-learned.

Pain is again a response and responses to stimuli can be mitigated or reduced but I don't think this statement is either truthful nor helpful.

751  -1.0      1 patients  This one genuinely made me laugh. If you could teach my brain to unlearn pain please do. That has to be one of the most asinine and condescending statements I've read yet. If people are actually saying this to others, they should be ashamed.  How would you feel if you're injured and instead of being helped someone just said unlearn that pain?

Again, this is encroaching on the dangerous notion of those with neuropathy or similar exhibiting psychological weakness

794   1.0      1 patients  I think to an extent this might be true through extreme training such as military and controlled martial arts. I can learn to ignore that kind of pain to a degree. I can also be trained to fight through pain such as pain caused by pepper spray. It still hurts though, so I wouldn't say it the pain response has been unlearned. Maybe dulled or being taught how to deal with it. Chronic pain is different in my opinion. Pain that is always there would be very hard to train through, especially if the pain increases when doing certain things. In that case, it would be a constant reminder. So, even though the comment may be insightful to a degree, I don't think it is necessarily true.

That doesn't seem helpful.

I would also assume that you had no real experience with pain.

809  -1.0      0 controls  I feel that this statement is incredibly reductive and equivalent to "homosexuality is a mental disorder that can be cured through prayer and Bible study". It is possible for pain to be psychosomatic, but it is insulting to tell someone that they can just decide to not be in pain, regardless of what is causing them pain.

819  -1.0      1 patients  Honestly its BS. Yes, its true for some people but others spend years working toward recovery and never get there. I've had pain for 2.5 years and I work hard everyday to get better but I honestly feel the same as the day it all started. I haven't given up but your statement undermines my efforts at getting better and the severity of pain, like oh if you try hard you won't be in pain anymore. That doesn't work for everyone. My mom has chronic pain too and she rarely has pain anymore, it worked for her so I do understand the statement but its worded wrong and is frankly upsetting for those of us who try and get no results. So, please reword it. Please                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
820  -1.0      1 patients  I do everything I can to lower my pain levels. This started with an injury. Unless you can fix what is left of it, it will never completely resolved. I know that and so I keep working at doing the best I can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
821  -1.0      1 patients  While some techniques can be used to lessen the bodies response to pain, to suggest that it is entirely a learned effect is absurd. Pain is a response to chemical signalling pathways and occurs in animals without the ability to learn, without fully functional nervous systems even. Again this statement suggests that the feeling of pain is a conscious choice similar to teaching oneself a new language

847   0.0      1 patients  So I feel two ways about this.   I think pain isn't learned, it's just something someone feels physically, mentally or emotionally. But by understanding what the pain is, a person can teach themselves to decrease or to no longer feel pain.   Like with my condition, I need to use dilators to stretch the vagina.  At first I was in tears and I was frustrated from the pain. However as time went by and I kept going up the dilator sizes, I no longer felt pain, I just felt a stretching feeling. Kind of like learning how to do the splits, it hurts, but you know that the pain is caused by stretching of the muscles.

It's a biological reaction to signal us that something might be dangerous or otherwisely is wrong. It's what causes us to remove our hand from the hot plate by reflex.

I know neurons that fire together wire together, but there's no way to stop a painful nerve impulse from traveling when I overextend my shoulder without chopping off my shoulder. My nerves have been practicing pain for 22 years, I don't have that kind of time to unlearn it. You wouldn't try to unlearn the reflex that removes your hand from a hot pan, what makes you think I can and should unlearn pain? It's not chronic because I'm exaggerating or have a nerve disorder, it's chronic because my ligaments are letting my body go past the point where pain should be triggered.

Even if it is learned, this is still wrong and confusing - walking is learned but that does not mean it can be (easily) unlearned. Most importantly this is condescending as it frames pain as something which can merely be ignored or forgotten, when for most people and in most contexts that is not the case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
897   0.0      0 controls  I haven't heard of this idea before, but if there was a research paper testing this specifically I would be interested in reading it.

902  -1.0      1 patients  Statements like this are not scientifically grounded and are extremely frustrating to chronic pain patients.  Many of us learn to function with pain or even successfully mask our pain, but we do not "unlearn" the experience of pain itself.

951  -1.0      1 patients  This is another one I think is technically true but unhelpful. "learned" is a word that almost always means "learned on purpose" so unless this phrase is delivered alongside enough neuroscience to make sense of it, it can sound like victim-blaming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
954  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  This statement is condescending and inaccurate. Yes we can learn about our bodies and ourselves and take actions and make choices that support our health and well being. But "unlearn pain" is again a reductionist view that can place a perfectionist and unrealistic expectation on a person in pain. What if it doesn't work and they still have pain? Who failed? Better to focus on quality of life, self care and self compassion skills and learning how to laugh again. That's how we begin to support people in changing their pain.

973  -1.0      1 patients  I guess if someone expects something is going to be painful, they can talk themself into it, but it think this is rare and only in specific instances.  I doubt you can convince someone with Covid19 or someone who has been burned ina house fire that their pain is learned and they can just learn how to turn it off.  Again, I have not come across any research to back this up, but if true, I sure would love how to turn off my pain.

981   1.0      2 HCNoPain  Asking someone to examine a lifetime of beliefs which forged their neural construct around what pain is and how it affects them both consciously and subconsciously, in order to rewire their internal matrix, is the million dollar question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
982   1.0      3 HCPain    Im sure pain is exacerbated through life through learned behaviors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
985  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  I disagree with the 1st 1/2 of the statement. But the 2nd half could be empowering if it was paired with an action statement. Pain can be unlearned when combined with [insert action/occupation/leisure/self-care strategy/CBT]

1014  0.0      1 patients  It is helpful to assert that pain is learned by the body and therefore can be unlearned, however the phrasing feels as if the responsibility and "blame" for the issue is on me. As if I have learned my pain and have not been consciously trying to unlearn it and that is why I am still suffering. This may be true, but the phrasing isn't tactful and I know many chronic pain sufferers are sensitive to any suggestion that this is their own fault (something we are told too often, or feel intensely for ourselves due to the shame surrounding these things). The sentence reminds me of an old feeling - "you must have done something wrong for this situation to be the case".

1036 -1.0      1 patients  I understand the reasoning behind this statement but it trivialises the pain and it implies that you can choose not to be in pain.

1041 -1.0      1 patients  I don't believe all pain is learned. Thus not all pain can be unlearned. I do believe, however, that even some nociceptive pain canÂ be muted for a littleÂ while by ignoring its existence. But it takes energy, and eventually comes back, sometimes harder.Â this statement may be true, it depends on the root of the pain.

1043 -1.0      1 patients  Angry should be in your list of responses. No one who has had a condition like migraine since childhood will buy into the notion that the pain was learned and can simply be undone.

1060 -1.0      1 patients  I wish this were true, as it would solve a lot of my health concerns. To an extent I believe the mind can be "distracted" to experience low levels of pain differently. However, I don't believe that pain is a response to conditioning. I hope I'm wrong on this, because if I am, someday I might be able to live a pain free life.

1064  0.0      1 patients  The statement is true and also empowering to the patient. But a doctor who leads with it might find the patient shut down after this first sentence.  There's a necessary context required to understand this concept, namely that pain is processed in the brain and the brain is plastic.   Otherwise this statement sounds a lot like "you hurt because you're overreacting, you're making a mountain out of a molehill, it's your own fault, try meditating, here's a pamphlet, payment is required when services are rendered, have a nice day."

1078 -1.0      3 HCPain    We know this is true, but the general public struggle with these concepts. Norman Doige may have explained them to a small percentage of our population, but it's not general knowledge. The structure of this statement also suggests that the individual, or 'the learner,' is responsible for his or her pain. And that won't ever win any converts.

1112 -1.0      3 HCPain    Are we talking literally (just think that pain doesn't exist and it will go away) or metaphorically (as a way to describe improper sensitization or similar)? In the literal case I'd wish that "philosophical estoppel" was a legal justification so that I could forcibly give the author a hot-sauce enema. In the metaphorical case it doesn't provide any useful or actionable information. At best it's an attempt to provide a metaphor to explain how a known-effective treatment works.

It makes it sound as if pain is a choice and I can just "turn it off."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
1127  1.0      2 HCNoPain  Interesting proposition. Pain is certainly a dynamic concept heavily influenced by nurture influences. However, I do would not called it strictly "learned" either, as to some extent it inherently exists.

1129  0.0      2 HCNoPain  Pain is an inherent to the human body. It cannot be totally removed. An individual can learn how to deal with pain and to lessen it's negative connotation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
1130  0.0      2 HCNoPain  Whether this is helpful or condescending depends on the context. I think mostly this is just condescending and making it sound like the person is simply choosing to be in pain but I can imagine circumstances where this is used to begin discussion of techniques that can be used to minimize (not eliminate) pain.

While it indicates a way forward to reduce pain, it has a whiff of victim-blaming.

However, my understanding is pain is generated in 'lower/hind' brain which is, for most people, beyond their conscious control.

1234 -1.0      1 patients  Our RESPONSE to pain is learned, but pain itself is an innate part of being human, like seeing or the sense of touch. I understand that pain can be relieved in some cases by adapting thinking patterns or movements, but this statement makes it sound like there are people out there living with no pain from anything that happens to them in life because they were raised right.

1277 -1.0      2 HCNoPain  In a similar way to phrasing cancer treatment as a "battle" that needs to be "fought" by the patient, individuals can feel at fault for worsening cancer outcomes (or pain) because they are not doing enough or trying hard enough.

But for EDS, it's only mild helpful.
