0     0.0       3 HCPain    Yes, pain is a normal part of life, but can become abnormal, where prolonged suffering becomes prominent and destructive.  So this statement only refers to more day-to-day injuries and stresses.  Without pain we would not learn many things!

13    0.0       1 patients  I'm not sure on this one.  I feel as though it may make some angry.  There are definitely lots of people that I know, and likely others know, that are not in pain.  That leads me to believe it isn't "normal".  Maybe the statement should be, "Feeling pain to stimulus is normal", or something like that.  You want to find a way of saying that feeling pain is normal, without saying that being in chronic pain is normal.

34    1.0       2 HCNoPain  Potentially useful to normalize the individual's experience from the standpoint, we all experience pain from time to time in life and usually as an imperative the word is a call to action. However, the statement likely does lend itself to invalidating an individual or minimizing their experience.

60    0.0       2 HCNoPain  Most of these short, pithy statements lack context. Pain can certainly be a normal and expected response to a variety of situations. If we knew why chronic pain stayed chronic, for example, because of abnormal neural processes, it could still be considered normal for that situation.

99    0.0       1 patients  It is certainly normal to feel pain, but when pain is debilitating and impairs your ability to live a full life, then it is ceases to be. I think it's the severity and duration of pain in chronic pain patients that will never be normal. Normal pain directly correlates to the stimuli experienced. Chronic pain is a step above.

113   1.0       2 HCNoPain  Pain can be "normal", and therefor not something to be alarmed by. Bit sometimes, pain can be alarmingly abnormal, and needs acute attention.

120   0.0       2 HCNoPain  I think this depends on the situation.

187  -1.0       1 patients  Could be used to pacify but also to patronise. Health care professionals currently have no way to measure pain objectively, so this phrase could be taken out of context by someone experiencing pain.

238   0.0       2 HCNoPain  This could be either. Acute pain is very normal. Chronic pain is very common, perhaps normal sometimes but definitely not always normal. I think it can be helpful to normalize pain in our society to minimize pain related fear and disability or excessive pain related worry. But it could also come across as minimizing, invalidating and hurtful. Surely someone who is very disabled by their pain wouldn't feel that the degree of pain they are experiencing is normal.

WE SUFFER WE LOSE OUR SOCIAL LIVES, RECREATION, friends family and a reason to live dont ever try to tell me thats normal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
261  -1.0       1 patients  Normalizing the experience of physical pain is a truly terrible perspective. Like bugs in a kitchen, it's normal but should still be prevented & fought                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
262  -1.0       1 patients  Even if pain is normal, the degree of pain experienced by chronic pain patient isn't. Saying that pain is normal feels diminishing of the experience of chronic pain sufferers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
263  -1.0       1 patients  Of course it is.  But the definition of "normal" is the sketchy part.  What is normal?  It's been my experience that it's just a setting on a clothes washer.    I can easily cut my hands and arms with little to no pain.  I've suffered so much damage to my nerves, that often I only realize I'm hurt, when I start getting blood everywhere.  That's my normal, but it's -far- from normal.  To compare me to a child who has never experienced a cut wound?  Foolish.  I've had 4 major open spine surgeries, and have a very different relationship with pain.  Does it make my pain less valid than a person who has never experienced physical trauma?  No.

298  -1.0       0 controls  Pain is not normal. It's caused by injury or disease. Pain is thus response to abnormal conditions in the body, which makes pain abnormal, because it doesn't occur without the stimulas.

However, if it is said to minimize the amount of pain a person is having, I do not like the statement.

320  -1.0       3 HCPain    Pain is a normal thing for people to experience. However, telling this to a chronic pain sufferers makes them feel invalidated. My diagnosis was pushed back by over a decade by doctors telling me my pain was normal and nothing to worry about with little or no examination. Every time I heard this made me feel like they thought I was trying to get drugs or was a hypochondriac. I still struggle with those feelings even now having been in the medical field for six years and doing a massive amounts of my own research digging through various studies and medical journals. I am often times the expert in the room on Ehlers-Danlos while at doctor appointments, with the few exceptions of physicians that work in specific specialties.

346   0.0       3 HCPain    At the same time validating and condescending depending on context.  Yes, pain is a normal reaction, almost everyone perceives pain in one situation or another, one way or another. So it's a shared human condition and it's reassuring that others can relate.  At the same time it can be seen as a way to down-play and dismiss the experience and severity of the problem. It's something women often have to deal with. Their pain, especially when it's something about the reproductive tract, is all too often ignored and declared to be "normal" when it really isn't.

Neither helpful or confusing, just a rather neutral statement.

399   1.0       1 patients  In many cases, pain is normal, especially within context of physical illness or injury. If you burned your hand on the stove and it didn't hurt, the lack of pain would be considered abnormal.

If a doctor said this I would assume they do not care about my pain and do not wish to try and help me.

492  -1.0       1 patients  Yes, pain is normal in how every human has experienced pain at least once. But we need to take note when someone is complaining about being in pain all the time, because that (being in pain all the time) is not normal.

508   1.0       1 patients  Pain is a normal function of the body to indicate a problem. It is an important tool in recognizing what is and isn't supposed to be happening. If the patient understands that it is not only ok, but expected to experience and identify pain, they may be better able to monitor, manage, and share what they are experiencing with their healthcare team.

516  -1.0       1 patients  That is frustrating. Someone experiencing chronic pain wants to feel like there's a way to feel better not like this is the normal way to feel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
518   0.0       1 patients  It is true, but there are also abnormal amounts of pain and it's OKAY that I want to live a more normal life like my friends who are able to balance grad school and three jobs or who work full time and can have friends on top of that. Or even for me to want to be like the friends who have a very high intensity career. Pain is normal, but it's also fine to want to be at a normal level of pain.

537  -1.0       1 patients  I have chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy in my feet. I have been in constant pain for about 13 years. I live with it and use Lyrica or gabapentin. I have congestive heart failure also from chemo. All I need is about 30 - 5mg hydrocodone or similar medication for bad days, since I can't have NSAIDS. 30 pills would last me for months. I can't get that in the U.S. It would change my life. It causes me a lot of distress since Dr.s only want me on expensive, long term medications like Lucynta. But you know, U.S. healthcare is so political.

540   0.0       1 patients  Pain is a normal reaction and feeling. However, saying this exact phrase to someone with chronic pain can make them feel hopeless.

643  -1.0       0 controls  Some pain in life is normal. The level of pain that people with chronic pain experience at all times is not normal, and telling them that it is normal is calling them liars or, at best, overreacting. I under-reacted when I was in chronic pain, because I literally did not remember what pain-free felt like. As I recovered I kept telling my husband that all of my pain was gone... only to tell him, a free weeks later, that I had been wrong, and *now* all of my pain was gone. That happened about a half-dozen times before I truly got pain-free. Comparing chronic pain to normal pain is not accurate and is very misleading and harmful.

Yes pain exists as a physiological reaction to external stress of some kind, and without pain of any kind we would not know if our bodies were damaged.

If used to communicate that the person feeling constant pain is "not a freak" and "not weak" and that to be feeling such pain with their condition is normal, this is an insightful, comforting statement. If used to dismiss a person's pain and tell them to "get over it" and stop looking for help to reduce it, or to minimize the severity of their pain, then it is condescending.

706  -1.0       1 patients  This doesn't even strike me as true. Pain may be good and adaptive as a signal to help you keep yourself safe or avoid/leave dangerous situations or stay off of a damaged body part so it can heal, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it normal. Experiencing fatigue or hunger is "normal", they happen regardless of whatever else is going on- pain happens when something is wrong, it's not a thing we should just expect to feel. If by calling it normal you merely mean that it's part of the expected run of human experience, it's not even reassuring to say so. People already know that everyone else also feels pain sometimes and it's inane and condescending to point it out to the vast majority of people.

It is important for individuals to understand that pain is a normal part of life and that pain isn't something one should be afraid of or immediately alleviated. However, chronic pain which affects ones quality of life and mental state is not normal and should be addressed with appropriate management techniques.

751  -1.0       1 patients  Just because something is normal doesn't mean it should be. Also different levels of pain should be taken into accounted. If I break a leg and I'm in pain, it's normal but doesn't mean that saying it's normal is a reason to not treat it. If I have arthritis and am in uncomfortable pain but not unbearable pain in the morning, it's normal.  Does that mean I should accept that is just the way life is going to be. Undermining someone's pain by indicating it's normal is just belittling. Of course pain in life is going to happen,  but it doesn't mean we should lose hope that some day there will be a way to minimize it. Please don't say pain is normal.

794  -1.0       1 patients  Pain is not at all normal. It may be normal in certain situations but it is not normal to just experience pain. If I am sitting down in a chair, there should be no pain. If I do have pain because of chronic lower back issues, that is not normal. Pain is designed to tell the brain and the body that something is "off".

819  -1.0       1 patients  Pain is ONLY normal for those without chronic pain. You get a cut it stings, you bruise your knee it aches, you lift too much you're sore. But for people with chronic pain, pain isn't normal. Pain is intensified. It is normal to have pain, yes. But it is NOT normal to have every muscle in your body feel like its being torn apart and every joint to feel like it was smashed with a car.

A cancer patient wouldn't be expected to continue on as normal, because pain is a normal part of life. It completely glossed over the fact that extremes of both intensity and duration of pain have profound effects, both physically and psychologically.

837   1.0       3 HCPain    This needs to be said more often. I think if Pts expect pain sometimes- post surgical, with chronic conditions, with injury- they would be less alarmed by it. Of course we live in a society that tells people that pain is always bad and that zero pain is the normal baseline, which isn't helpful.

847  -1.0       1 patients  Pain is not normal. This is a big issue I have with doctors ignoring patients pain and saying that it's normal. The body should not be feeling pain , especially chronic pain.  I do believe that some pain can be a state of mind, but pain needs to be treated 100% of the time.

902  -1.0       1 patients  Everyone experiences pain, but not everyone experiences the same frequency or intensity of pain.   To give an anecdote:  My partner, who is a healthy 27-year-old man, asked me late one night if he should go to the emergency room because he was feeling a pain in his side. I asked him to rate the pain from 0-10. He chose 2.  My average daily pain level is 3 or 4 out of 10. For my partner, even a level 2 pain is so unusual that it caused him serious concern.

1042  0.0       1 patients  This could make a patient who's experiencing severe chronic pain expect their condition to become their new normal; that is, this might tip them over the edge into self-harm and suicidality. However, this could be spun as, "For people with a similar experience as yourself (injury/procedure/occupation,etc.), we are aware that pain often occurs, and that pain is normal. This is to say, your pain is real, it is normal, and we'll do the best to work with you to manage your pain."

1060 -1.0       1 patients  Yes, pain is a normal sensation in the way that everyone will experience it at some point. However, chronic pain is not "normal" in the sense that it's caused by bodily anomalies. For instance, I wouldn't be struggling with chronic pain if I didn't have a bone disease that caused me to break 200x with 25 femoral roddings. Sure, I'm probably on the farther end of the spectrum when it comes to chronic pain, but in my case specifically I don't think that the pain levels that I have are "normal".

1064 -1.0       1 patients  Not helpful. Pain is common, that's not the same as normal.  Just because pain characterizes a great deal of lived human experiences does not mean we should accept the quantity or quality of those experiences.  Pain is a signal that something is wrong. While your brain might draw incorrect conclusions from stimuli and signal erroneously that something is wrong, we don't want to normalize pain.  People who can't react to pain are dangerous to themselves and others.  People who are misinterpreting pain can and should be treated. We need to find a way to correct the misperception, not normalize it.  Is that nitpicking? Well, yes and no.

1079  0.0       1 patients  If you're in chronic pain for an undiagnosed reason, often the first thing you want to know is if the pain is a sign you're dying or in danger. Pain is supposed to be the sign of something wrong. Pain is normal (all people experience it). But for a paintypical person, pain is the sign of abnormality. I'm on the fence as to whether this actually says anything at all of use.

1112  1.0       3 HCPain    This at least seems to be compassionate. Many people may be worried about what pain they are experiencing means. That is, they may think it indicates that something is a lot worse or unmanageable than it really is. Such an explanation at least provides reassurance that something abnormal hasn't occured.  As a more general statement it's not that helpful. In the sense of "the experience of pain occurs at least occasionally to the majority of the human population" it's useless and unactionable. I also worry that it will be used as a justification to avoid providing adequate pain management.

1120 -1.0       1 patients  I'm unsure where I stand on this. On one hand, it feels as though the person is at least accepting my descriptions of my experience, but it also feels dismissive. "Pain is normal" makes it sound like I don't need treatment because this is how it's supposed to be and everything is fine.

A certain base level of pain is probably felt constantly by many people and it rises with age. Especially if one includes any kind of discomfort in the definition of pain - which would make it a moot point then. Hot searing pain is not a normal constant sentiment. Feeling sharp and bothering pain at specific moments is normal. This phrase says everything and nothing by itself.

As a general statement it's a bit too obvious.

1234  1.0       1 patients  This emphasizes that it is good and healthy to have the ability to feel pain. It is an important way the body communicates with the concious mind that something is wrong. But, I do feel like this statement needs to be followed up with something else to be useful (are we gonna talk about a disease where someone can't feel pain? Are we going to talk about how constant pain is not normal and you should probably get that looked at?) I think that too many patients expect to be pain free and the idea of "manageable pain" is infathomable. The idea of pain control during/after any medical procedure is not that you feel nothing, and using systemic pain relievers to the extent that your pain is entirely gone after a major procedure can have severe negative side effects that are not worth the pain relief.

1300 -1.0       3 HCPain    "Normal" is problematic because it can be helpful to understand it's universal experience but it can also suggest a normative response, so some people may interpret their pain experience as "doing it wrong".
