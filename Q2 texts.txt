13   -1.0      1 patients  Yes, pain is an output of the brain.  However, that doesn't always tell the full story.  It doesn't help if that pain signal is coming from something else.  Something like real nerve damage, or damage somewhere else.

126   1.0      0 controls  The brain is responsible for all our sensory modalities. Without it one can't percieve any sensory information. As stated above, the brain receives a signal that the steady state has changed, which goes on to elicit a pain response. The interesting part is that sometimes  if the individual is not fully cognizant of the change, then the brain won't elicit the pain response. Similar to you running through a bush and scraping your legs because you're being chased by a bear. in this scenario the tissue damage is sustained and the brain most likely ignores it because there is greater threat involved. once you reach safety and you notice your leg is bleeding you may start to feel pain. This is also seen in war when soldiers are shot in battle and they keep trooping forward not realizing they've been shot until they reach safety and acknowledge the wound which triggers the pain.  So context is important but in the end, the brain does elicit the pain response if it take priority given the circumstance.

And pain is actually an output of the brain but it's influenced and determined by several factors, many of them not structural So, again, I think we (health professionals) must be careful

This phrase makes one think that they are being told that their pain is imaginary.

If I have lower back pain it feels like it's my back and not my brain hurting.

217  -1.0      1 patients  Okay well most of us feel pain in our BODIES as that's all we can ever experience. Even so, the computational model of cognition this statement clearly originates from is a weak one. I prefer enactivism. Anyway, more and more people tend to prefer holistic perspectives as ones like these tend to be very reductive and diminish people's problems with pain. Trusting your doctors insight is as important as their skill set for me and many others I have spoken to (I have conducting many anthropological projects on chronic pain patients and am one myself). This statement also feeds into misconceptions that chronic pain is caused by poor mental health and is the fault of the patient. Many patients find themselves having to argue with family and friends that this for the most part not true.

This may be helpful or insightful info for another person though                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
321  -1.0      1 patients  I mean, yeah, I think most people with chronic pain at least have a basic understanding that the brain and spine are responsible for relaying pain signals.

382   0.0      1 patients  Pain is part of a feedback loop between the brain and the nerves. In one way, it could be an output, but it also interprets signals from elsewhere. To my knowledge, the brain has no nerves though, and cannot in itself, feel pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
384  -1.0      1 patients  I have heard this and it was always said in a condescending tone, like I was imagining the pain. A pain clinician said this to me with a fuller explanation and validated that the pain is still very real.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
385  -1.0      1 patients  This is too facile: so is vision, or taste, or pleasure. Yes, pain is the brain interpreting signals from receptors in the body, but that doesn't take us anywhere as far as coping or relieving the experience.

423  -1.0      1 patients  It often makes it sound as if feeling pain (especially when the source of the pain is not obvious/clearly visible/ understandable to somebody without the condition), is a choice that could be ignored and is simply a â€žmade up" output of our brains. Basically stating that you are crazy, overreacting, etc.

456  -1.0      3 HCPain    As a patient, I know this. The pain interprets signals from nerves and outputs a sensation as a result, including pain. Again - this does not help me or my pain.

462  -1.0      1 patients  My condition was not diagnosed for years because they refused to believe the pain was real. This was in Ireland. I eventually got diagnosed in China.

508  -1.0      1 patients  All sensory experience is ultimately an output and understanding interpreted by the brain. Experiencing chronic pain means we likely already know that and don't need to be told repeatedly. We want to know what might the underlying cause of the chronic pain might be if it is not already identified and what might help improve or prevent future pain.

520  -1.0      1 patients  When I've gotten to the point of asking for help from a doctor, I'm usually in a lot of pain. Philosophical statements don't help. What I want is a return to being able to function. If the doctor cannot treat the underlying problem, I would rather be told that there is nothing to reduce the inflammation (or that options are there but problematic).

529   1.0      1 patients  We know that you can be in pain despite no physical damage.

532  -1.0      1 patients  This is true, but how would this help me as a patient? I am highly educated and understand this, but it does not help me to manage my chronic pain on a daily basis or improve my quality of life. It seems dismissive.

572  -1.0      1 patients  lots of pain patients are often told that we're mentally ill, that were hypochondriacs, that it's just anxiety etc. similar to above, while an understandable statement, it can be dismissive if not explained properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
573  -1.0      1 patients  That saying makes me feel like something is "all in my head." While I am not a healthcare provider, I do provide legal services for chronic pain patients. How I phrase it when talking about the brain component is that the brain is connected to the pain and they affect each other.

When the pain is all over and bones and organs bend and move further than they should, there is only so much mindfulness you can practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
575  -1.0      1 patients  Obviously pain signals are sent from the brain but this statement (from my perspective) implies that the pain is all in the patient's head and they are imagining the pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
577  -1.0      1 patients  This implies that "it's all in my head" and that I'm just a hysterical woman that doesn't ACTUALLY hurt.   Also, of course it's an output of the brain. Literally EVERYTHING is controlled by the brain. But just because it's in my head, doesn't mean it's not REAL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
579  -1.0      1 patients  I'd like to think they mean that there are healthy ways to handle pain on a day to day basis and not that pain is something we have any sort of control over. If that's the case, no one knows better than people dealing with chronic pain that you can find coping mechanisms and different ways to deal with it. You even do it naturally. Otherwise we couldn't get through any day. But if we've come seeking medical help it's because we're in a level of pain we can't cope with anymore on our own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
580  -1.0      1 patients  statement needs to be more specific and needs clarity because too many patients are told by doctors that the pain is "all in their head"

It is fact, but it often used by medical professionals in a condescending manner to communicate that the pain felt does not matter because "it is all in your head". That said because it is fact, it can also be said in such a way that it is not condescending, if it leads to discussing why the brain is outputting such pain.

744  -1.0      1 patients  This may not be helpful. Patients often are looking for ways to manage pain. If nothing is apparent as to the cause, maybe can suggest ways to manage the pain and stress of the pain. Patients are often written off for chronic pain. No one wants to feel unheard or as if it's all in their head.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
751  -1.0      1 patients  Again I understand that pain is a signal sent by the brain saying there's a problem (in some cases). It says nothing to a patient experiencing pain. Why would that even matter to a patient who is experiencing an issue.

753   1.0      2 HCNoPain  Similar to my previous response.  To the person suffering pain, it comes across as unsympathetic and potentially condescending.  However as a practitioner it is a useful piece of information that forms part of our time to educate patients that pain is not a good indicator as to The severity of Tissue damage.  It's also our role to educate patients that not all pain is bad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
754   0.0      3 HCPain    Yes, sure, but it is also linked to the physical body and I don't think you can accurately separate the two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
759  -1.0      1 patients  Again this statement, although good for the health care provider to know and understand, is not helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
760  -1.0      1 patients  Of course it's coming from the brain in a sense (seeing as a lot of pain has to do with the nerves), but I don't think it's helpful to specify that. I think it's more useful to figure out why the pain response is being triggered at all.

794   1.0      1 patients  I would say it is helpful but I thought it was more common knowledge. I was always under the impression that if your nerves or whatever feel pain, the signal is sent to your brain to be processed as pain. You then know that whatever is happening is in fact, pain.

821  -1.0      1 patients  This statement is noisy often used to minimise the experiences of people in pain. Of course pain is an output of the brain, all of our sensorial experiences come from the brain, but they are still real. What's more it minimises the very real effects pain causes in body chemistry, such as increased cytokines

831  -1.0      1 patients  Like all emotions and sensations, pain is put out by the brain as a response to harmful stimuli. But like I said before in the previous response, reducing pain to just an 'output of the brain' can trivialize the patients experience. Pain should be taken seriously in all instances.

People tend to think pain is something you can just "willpower" your way through because of statements like this. Just because it's an output of the brain doesn't mean it's not real.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
837   1.0      3 HCPain    I wish there was an option to just say something is true instead of the options given. Insightful is the closest to it, so I've marked it.

847   0.0      1 patients  I want to say condescending, however in my case I know that this is a big problem. My brain expects the pain, therefore my muscles spasm, and cause me pain.   I do want to point out that the pain did not start with the imagination of the brain, it came from a legitimate physical issue. But the brain just makes it worse, because later it just expects the pain and makes you think you're feeling it, even if it's not as sever as the brain makes you think it is.

The pain that they are experiencing is very real, but individuals with chronic pain could maybe find it useful in distancing themselves from it.

859  -1.0      1 patients  It seems to disconnect pain from problem. It isn't untrue, but it seems like an unnecessary statement given most every experience is done so through the brain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
861   1.0      1 patients  I think there's so much more to learn about the brain. Things that have been dismissed as psychosomatic (even if the term is technically correct, it carries a stigma) are starting to be understood. My brain may very well be generating pain signals without there being an anatomical stimulus; that doesn't make my pain any less real that someone suffering from a broken leg.

That said, from a more scientific/philosophical perspective this sentence oversimplifies things and precludes a more nuanced understanding of pain and sensation as an emergent phenomena at the junction of mind and body (or something like that!)

905  -1.0      1 patients  For me this is undecided. I can understand my neck, shoulder, back, jaw, and head pain all derives from my spinal problem. Yet I also have an "undiagnosed" condition that presents as restless legs. I've had it as long as I can remember and none of my doctors understand it. It's similar to anxiety, but it isn't, it's like a pain that progressively spreads through my limbs. I used to think I was experiencing irritation or maybe a psychological problem, but I've addressed that and my symptoms still persist.

936   0.0      1 patients  I agree with the fact but I've come across doctors who have used that fact to not look for a physical root cause of my pain.

943   1.0      1 patients  When it's about the fact that the brain is misinterpreting signals from the body, where pain is coming from something where damage isn't being done, that's fair.

944   1.0      1 patients  I have congenital scoliosis. Although I found long walks painful as a kid, I was only finally diagnosed when I was 28 and offered no treatment. Over the following 10 years therefore I taught myself to ignore the pain, since I decided it wasn't giving me any useful information. Now I only feel the pain in my back or hip if I am doing something awkward that is going to send my back muscles into spasm. That type of pain is intense and since it is giving me useful information I take note of it and cease the activity. I have tried applying this same attitude of ignoring pain to other types of pain I experience. A lot of the time it works, but only on background pain. New pain (such as a migraine or recent injury) cannot be ignored in the same way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
951  -1.0      1 patients  I found this confusing until I had learned a LOT about how the neuroscience of pain worked, it's true but it's also WAY too superficial to be useful in the form it's written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
954  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  Same answer as above. Would not use this when speaking to a person in pain. It would be confusing to them without a larger context of understanding and insight. Pain is a whole person, whole life experience and cannot be reduced into simplistic statements such as this one.

968   0.0      3 HCPain    I don't think it us that simple, I believe that it is Multifactorial a d tissues as well as the brain play a role.

973  -1.0      1 patients  Yes, I think all pain is connected to the nerves that are connected to your brain.  I am not sure I agree with people who say that I really don't have pain because I am so use to having pain, I just assume I have pain when I don't.  I have not found any reliable research to prove their theories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
974   0.0      3 HCPain    Pain is interpreted by the brain but that does not mean that it shouldn't be treated by health care practitioners. Having lived with a pain condition for 2 years, I feel as though it's the only problem that a patient can have that health care can completely essentially not treat and get away with. From a patient's perspective it's incredibly frustrating to live with unmanaged pain.

982   0.0      3 HCPain    I definitely think pain is a response to signals and chemicals in the brain.

985  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  Sounds like pain is "made up" by the brain to make sense of the world. For acute pain and a localized response, it's not accurate enough and for chronic pain, this would be unhelpful. It communicates the message that your brain is "making up" the pain.

1034 -1.0      1 patients  Quite honestly, while this statement may be true in a purely scientific standpoint, when you look at a patient as a whole, living embodiment of a person, this statement invalidates every aspect of their mental well-being when it comes to treating their pain. Pain - especially chronic pain - needs to be dealt with as a component of the patient's mental health (secondary to the obvious treatment of the actual pain). Being in pain 24/7 takes so much out of a patient's daily living, they have to adjust their life around how high their pain is at that moment. Being told that "pain is [just] an output of the brain" minimizes something that we live with and deal with more intimately than our own spouses/partners.

1041  1.0      1 patients  Insightful because it's not theÂ way it feels, yet true. This opens other options to deal with the pain. It would be entirely helpful if we keep in mind that this fact does not mean that the patient has enoughÂ to controlÂ and should deal with the pain alone.Â

1060  0.0      1 patients  Although pain IS an output of the brain, some people may interpret that as "the pain is in your head", "it's not real", or "you're being dramatic". I have been on the receiving end of physicians doubting my pain levels, even though I have broken my bones over 200x (mostly my femurs) and have a very high pain tolerance. When it's bad, it's very bad. Some physicians don't take you seriously, which I can understand being skeptical of pain levels due to the opioid epidemic, but there needs to be a balance.

1064 -1.0      1 patients  I'd actually say it's a condescending but entirely true statement. It's generally not a helpful comment on its own and can be greatly misconstrued by patients who feel that their pain is being invalidated.  That said, all pain is processed in the brain, you can't feel pain without it being translated by the brain into meaningful sensation.  I think that's a tremendously powerful insight if the patient can be helped to understand it.  After 23 years of chronic pain I've adopted a "pain is pain" philosophy. I treat all pain in my life the same way, whether it's emotional pain or physical pain or spiritual pain.  I use kratom as an alternative to traditional opioids (after detoxing from years of morphine). Kratom allows me to get restful sleep, which is half the battle.   I take gabapentin for nerve pain, as it covers pain opioids can't touch by virtue of affecting Substance P in the brain. I have arthritis pain and neuropathy (from both degenerative disease and labile diabetes), gabapentin helps with everything.  I take Cymbalta for depression, musculoskeletal pain (what I call "background pain"), and what cannabis smokers used to call "amotivational syndrome" (asthenia) when I was young.  I also try to eat an anti-inflammatory diet and I pray and meditate regularly. If I can't actually heal my body then I'm going to give my brain every possible tool to dampen down output.

People with chronic pain, especially if they are female have a hard time being believed by physicians and so I think this statement is harmful to patients by unintentially (I hope) reinforcing prejudice and misconceptions regarding pain. The statement should be more specific to avoid misinterpretation. It is also reminiscent of toxic positivity in the context of illness e.g., you can magically cure yourself with positive thinking. So I find the statement doubly harmful.

1078  1.0      3 HCPain    In fact Lorimer Moseley has said it may take the death of the current leaders in this field, for pain science to be accepted.

1111  0.0      0 controls  Pain is an output of the brain but also an input. Pain can be psychological or physical. When an 8 year old walks down stairs to their parents one morning and complains that their stomach hurts and they can't go to school, their pain is real, but that doesn't mean anything is actually wrong with the child. He or she just does not want to go to school. This is an example of pain being an output. When someone breaks their leg, pain is an input. Neurons are firing to let a person know, "hey we have a problem, your leg is broken."

Stoicism may be *right*, but that doesn't mean you can enable someone to take it up through a 1-sentence phrase.

1120 -1.0      1 patients  Too many times I've heard doctors and others in the medical field that my pain is all in my head and instead of putting in the work to try to help me improve the quality of my life, they push me off to therapists (or sometimes send me home without any help if they don't want to do a referral).

1129  1.0      2 HCNoPain  Different people deal with pain in different ways. It has been shown that anticipated pain can be worse than unanticipated pain caused by the same event. Some people are able to mental block or lessen pain using certain mental exercises.

Saying the chest pain from a heart attack is merely output of the brain serves no value.

1140 -1.0      2 HCNoPain  Pain occurs due to activation of nerves, which doesn't start at the brain.

1184 -1.0      0 controls  Same problem as above: A useful fact if you're talking with scientists. But not useful to say to patients. It's like the WHO saying "there is no evidence that masks prevent coronavirus transmission." A scientist understands that lack of evidence does not mean evidence of lack. A civilian hears "masks don't prevent coronavirus transmission." This sounds like "if you're in pain it's not tied to reality and you're crazy."

1234  1.0      1 patients  I think this statement emphasizes that pain can be treated on multiples levels. If the injury cannot be healed at its peripheral source, we have medicines which act on the central nervous system to provide relief.  Pain perception has a huge psychological component to it too. Stress and psychological well being can worsen the severity of pain, while relaxation can soothe it.

1288  0.0      1 patients  I have learned about chronic pain as medical community interested it, and read books aimed at helping people. I'm not gonna be a great response.   But this type of statement had some helpfulness in the past, taught me how to dissociate more. Am I supposed to meditate for the rest of my life to train my brain to ignore pain signals?

I guess it could be helpful in certain contexts
