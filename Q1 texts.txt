13    0.0      1 patients  It really depends on the tone of the statement.  I've been given this phrase before.  Some of the times it was condescending and dismissive.  This was mainly during the 6 years it took me to figure out what was the issue (small fiber neuropathy), or the diagnosis phase.    I've been given this phrase after the diagnosis phrase, for other things. It was delivered in a helpful way to try and describe what was going on.  In that case, it was given when describing abdominal pain that was coming with ulcerative colitis (something that developed after neuropathy.)

It's a multifaceted experience that can be influenced by a lot of different things (p.s.: I have a pre-conceived bias of looking things in biopsychosocial perspective most of the time)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
60    1.0      2 HCNoPain  Helpful to the clinician. I am unclear how helpful this would be to the client/patient.   It is helpful because in MSK education pain is most often attributed to damage or pathology of some sort. If the clinician knows they cannot attribute a two-year-old MRI reading to a current pain presentation then it will not go uninvestigated. On the flip side, it may be unhelpful to the clinician who does not know how to assess pain without attributing it to damage that is either known (scan), assumed (symptoms) or made up (a host of MSK maladies not supported by evidence).

99   -1.0      1 patients  While entirely accurate, the wording itself can be belittling. To a chronic pain patient, it comes across as "just because you're in pain doesn't mean there is actually something wrong with you." At least that would be my knee-jerk reaction if someone were to say that to me, especially if it was said by a medical professional. It would instantly put me on the defensive and I would lose confidence in that person's ability to understand my condition and to help me at all.

110  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  True, but useless as long as you don't define tissue damage. A fracture is tissue damage. But what about degeneration, trigger point, inflammation etc? No pain without nociception. You can nociception without 'tissue damage'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
111   1.0      2 HCNoPain  For me it helps lay the foundation to explaining the complexities of pain. It is not saying it is nothing to do with tissue damage only that the state of the tissue is not the full picture. I hope it reassures them and then leads to understanding that it is safe to move if done sensibly.

126   0.0      0 controls  Pain is subjective. What one may feel as excruciating pain, another might feel as slight discomfort. Taking a reductionist view, I believe there is some unknown mechanism taking place at the cellular level that indicates a change in the steady-state of the body. This change (which may or may not be clear on the diagnostic imaging) elicits a response in the brain that indicates "danger or something is wrong, this is not the 'norm' ". However, you can't rule out obvious tissue damage as the source of pain in certain cases (breaking a bone or getting shot). Although, to say that all pain is due to tissue damage is egregiously wrong.

165   1.0      0 controls  I am currently finishing my physiotherapy degree, so I am obviously biased. But I think this type of information can be confusing to patients, because it can be a really different perspective than what their beliefs are or what they have been told to (even from health professionals). I think that if it was me, I would be really confusing and even stressed when very contrasting ideas are told me to be truth. And this can lead to distrust. So I think we must be cautios when we introduce some new perspectives or ideas to patients.

If I were reading this as a chronic pain patient, I would feel like my issues were being downplayed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
179  -1.0      1 patients  Sure, its not an accurate indicator but what is and what is the pain an accurate indicator for? From my position, pain is the indicator we have so telling me that its not that accurate for one thing isn't useful.

217  -1.0      1 patients  For chronic pain patients, pain is the entry point for understanding our condition. You don't specifically feel tissue damage, you feel pain. As modern medicine (pathology) favours measurable objectives, subjectively experienced symptoms become problematic for doctors to understand/'measure', complication diagnosis processes and decreased a sense of trust from patients. This statement may hit home for most patients who have experienced trust issues with doctors not understanding or even believing symptoms (I have personally had doctors not believe me). This statement is then a perfect example of how medical professionals may favour objective symptoms to subjective ones, when for most patients the pain is all that they feel and want to go. It also sounds as though the pain does not matter in this statement. Also plays into common practice for doctors to shove people on pain medication and call it a day rather than get to a route cause. I have been trying for 8 years to get to the cause of my fibromyalgia and have recently been asked by a family friend doctor why I've never seen a neurologist as they were certain it is nerve damage. I told them I have fibromyalgia and they said 'ahhh and doctors normally switch off after you tell them that huh?'

236  -1.0      1 patients  So considering tissue including muscle, epithelial, connective and nervous tissue, I understand the sentiment but if pain exists there must be a nervous tissue issue if no other type of tissue problem is observed. Pain is subjective so I can agree with this statement, but I can also see how it could be harmful due to generalization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
238   1.0      2 HCNoPain  It is helpful when it is understood and given context.  Without explanation, I think people could find it unhelpful or minimizing.

Most doctors in my experience will stop once they have determined there is no tissue damage, despite the levels of pain I experience daily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
244   0.0      3 HCPain    It is a part of my daily work speeches to get patients to understand that each and every nuance of their pain does not need to be felt, weighed and analyzed as that can be part of the problem. So it's insightful. Without proper background and explanation it certainly sounds condescending.

262  -1.0      1 patients  It's not really useful from our perspectives as chronic pain sufferers to have this information if we do not have concrete steps to take with handling this pain in general.

308  -1.0      1 patients  Regardless what The actual damage is, pain is a physical condition itself that can be at best uncomfortable and at worst debilitating.

311  -1.0      1 patients  I will quote Dr Stuart McGill, the world's foremost spine biomechanics specialist: "There is always a cause". Yes, I know nerves can be funny, I know pain can be referred, I know there's a psychological component to pain. *Component*. But there is always a cause. Things have swung WAY too far in the direction of psychosocial contributors. It's absurd, actually absurd, and a fad. Rather than admit the limits of medicine (and some systems are worse than others) or the possibility of error, clinicians will say, it's in the head. Gaslighting is what it is, on a mass scale. (Technically yes it's in the head as obviously the CNS is involved. But I don't believe "conversion disorder" is as common as arrogant physicians say it is. Even Freud would balk at how quickly these egoists go there. I think it's FAR more likely that they missed something. Or maybe the tech did, or maybe it was the imaging machine. Error happens, but you'd never know it, seeing how doctors deify reports.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
313   0.0      1 patients  This seems like something that would be said to me as a way to invalidate the pain that I am feeling, but it could also be a valid way to reassure somebody that is feeling a lot of pain.

359  -1.0      1 patients  It's important to know that pain doesn't directly indicate damage, but it's also frustrating and instinctively feels unfair.

364   0.0      1 patients  It is helpful because it is saying we cannot rely on pain to tell us about physical damage. It could be perceived as condescending because it seems dismissive of pain without apparent physical damage.

371  -1.0      1 patients  Pain is sometimes not an indicator of damage but I can seriously damage myself without noticing so I cannot afford to assume any pain is not damage. Often pain is the only way I know that something is wrong.   I have woken up with tendonopathy that was not apparent when I went to sleep. I have torn a muscle due to trying to stretch while I had a mild pain in my back.

It doesn't apply to me so much because there is consistent damage but explains conditions such as fibromyalgia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
375  -1.0      1 patients  Pain needs to be addressed instead of dismissed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
377   0.0      1 patients  Additional context needed. Is this a 'you're in too much pain for what we see' or a 'tissue damage doesn't always hurt as bad as advertised'?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
382   0.0      1 patients  This sounds logical, because pain is transmitted by nerves or can be psychosomatic in origin, but this is not always true. Pain could be an indicator of tissue damage, but not always.  Someone who has been badly burned may not have working pain receptors at the site of the burned tissue, but the tissue is still damaged.  Someone could also have an impinged nerve that has not yet resulted in damage to the tissues.  Also, capsaicin can cause trigger nociceptors, but doesn't necessarily indicate tissue damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
384   1.0      1 patients  I feel that pain is generally dismissed when no physical damage is found so this statement is quite validating to me.

I still think this statement diminishes the pain of people whose condition can't be recognized so easily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
394  -1.0      1 patients  I think it's worse when there's nothing obviously wrong to fix.

409  -1.0      1 patients  It does not tell me what my pain is caused by, and it is dismissive, suggesting that because I don't have obvious deformities I must not be in pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
414  -1.0      1 patients  It both matters and doesn't matter.

419  -1.0      1 patients  I was told this time and time again. I was told my pain was "growing pain" by so many doctors and that my hypermobility was normal and I would grow out of it. After years of being told this, I finally was told by my amazing geneticist that my pain was due to tissue damage that was caused by my hypermobility. Yes pain can be "idiopathic" but 9/10 there is a physical reason behind the pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
421   1.0      1 patients  It's promising that just because I have a lot of pain doesn't mean it's necessarily permanent, or that it's irreversible.

After multiple shoulder dislocations that were fairly painless, I presented with no pain whatsoever in my left shoulder. Orthopedist still wanted an MRI - and found extensive tissue damage that usually should impart range of motion and be extremely painful. So an underlying issue can cause lack of pain and symptoms while tissue damage does exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
425   1.0      2 HCNoPain  Often pain continues long after the tissues have healed. Also, under certain circumstances people can have enormous tissue damage but very little pain at the time the damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
428   1.0      1 patients  I have spoken to many other migraine sufferers about the fact that migraine pain does not occur because the brain is being damaged. It can be difficult to convince them this is factually true, even with supporting medical literature. It is insightful, but it can be a difficult concept to understand if you have only previously experienced pain from acute injury.

434  -1.0      1 patients  This leads to physicians refusing to adequately treat pain which may be real because the underlying tissue damage is not as severe as they expect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
435  -1.0      1 patients  That may be the case, but it does nothing to change the fact that there is still pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
441   1.0      1 patients  This is common sense. Pain is a personal experience that is relative and difficult to measure. It evolves even for the individual and in my experience the imaging rarely matches the pain felt.

It has nothing to do with why I am in pain, and is not useful to me in any way.

The root of pain is not one size fits all.

481  -1.0      1 patients  When I talk about pain, I am not necessarily trying to fix a internal problem like a tear or break, but I am trying to work on the pain that I feel every day. Just because there is no tissue damage doesn't mean there is no pain.

492   1.0      1 patients  I think it makes sense because I've had weird, unexplained pain most of my life.

514   0.0      1 patients  It really depends on the context. For example, if this was regarding nerve pain it could be true and helpful info. However if someone has a degenerative disease causing them pain and feels it is getting worse this could be dismissive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
518  -1.0      1 patients  I know that it's not an accurate indicator of tissue damage. It still hurts! I'm not actually concerned about that. It's not even about the acute pain- I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome so I do have acute issues (subluxation/dislocation). I don't care about acute pain since that's transitory. It's the continually pain and knowing that it's just like this (and it effects the rest of the life) that makes me irritable. I have accepted the reality that things will degenerate faster than in normal people and have adjusted to that, so my concern is not the tissue damage. I just want to feel better and be more involved in my life. That might be useful for some people to hear- but it's not my concern!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
520   0.0      1 patients  It depends on context. If I say that I'm worried about pain indicating tissue damage, then it is helpful. If it is in response to me saying that I'm in constant pain then it is condescending because it is usually a preface to telling me that I just have live with it. It is often part of an attempt to dismiss pain severity and my loss of function as medically irrelevant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
524   0.0      1 patients  If I was told this, I would honestly ask for elaboration because the phrase alone doesn't really tell me much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
525   1.0      1 patients  This seems accurate to me, since my own personal experience with pain is so varied and dependent on many different factors. I often prefer to speak more about my level of disability or annoyance/distraction when bringing up a pain problem.

Because it is true, just because you have pain doesn't necessarily mean there is tissue damage, and vice versa. Right? I'm just not sure.

530  -1.0      1 patients  The doctors here in USA are awful. It took years to get a diagnosis, and I  had several doctors tell me my symptoms were psychosomatic until my neurologist ran some labs. It's hard to say anything about pain as it is subjective. My body hurts badly, but I have few outward symptoms. Doctors dismiss pain, treat you as medication seeking, and cannot be bothered to run diagnostics. Also, our healthcare is terrible, and it is usually too expensive to afford medication, treatment, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
532  -1.0      1 patients  My rheumatologist wouldn't say this, because pain is a sign of active disease activity and joint erosion.

My take away from this is: solving for one may not resolve the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
553  -1.0      1 patients  In my situation it can be indicative of bone/tissue damage due to rheumatoid arthritis  but also due to fibromyalgia and neuropathy so any new, changes in pain need to be investigated not dimissed by medical professionals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
554  -1.0      1 patients  i'm not a doctor, so i'm not arguing that this statement isn't true, I just find it unhelpful. it would be better, in my opinion, to follow up to this statement with what the pain could indicate or what the next steps are. if it isn't followed up with some kind of meaningful next steps, it's dismissive.

557   0.0      1 patients  It's such a short comment that needs  a much bigger explanation. As is, it's condescending and not helpful. Something more along the lines of. Your pain center is sending out so much pain signals right now.

558  -1.0      3 HCPain    This is one more way doctors try to justify not treating pain. Chronic pain is like torture: hurts like hell and people just stand around and say "it's just pain, you can take it."

574  -1.0      1 patients  We are getting slow damage in our bodies over time and the best thing treatments to stabilize our pain and further damage is preventable. This statement rarely applies to EDS since the pain is an indicator for us that we are damaging something and we need intervention to prevent further damage which would prevent pain. The lack of pain treatment for the EDS community is embarrassing and demoralizing. Most of the depression you see from us is from being in so much physical pain and not being believed. Most doctors don't know enough about EDS if anything at all.

579  -1.0      1 patients  I know my condition (hEDS/dysautonomia) involves feelings of pain unrelated to tissue damage. Regardless of that, some of it is and/or will be (considering EDS progresses). I've had injuries due to chronic tendinitis on my shoulder that actually have showed up in scans as highly inflamed tissue. The doctor that ordered that test at first dismissed my pain because the tendon hadn't snapped yet. He then tried to slightly rotate my arm and apologized after I immediately started bawling, and only after that he ordered a test. Am I only allowed to seek medical help AFTER my tissue is permanently damaged?

583  -1.0      1 patients  Because my autoimmune disease presented from such a young age, doctors would say that a child's pain tolerance is lower than an adults, so my pain didn't equate to how much damage had been done to cartilage and bone in my hips. This resulted in my first two physicians not doing any MRIs or CTs, which eventually showed enough cartilage and bone damage to require surgery.

594   0.0      1 patients  I agree that, in some cases, that is true. However, if we are only looking at the treatment of chronic pain, it doesn't really matter what is causing the pain beyond what information is necessary for determining the best treatments. Nerve pain is still pain. Musculoskeletal pain is still pain. The only reason one would need a diagnosis to specifically indicate where pain is coming from, is so they can receive it the most appropriate treatment/medicine. Therefore, while I agree that, in some instances, pain is not an indicator of tissue damage, it really does not matter unless your purpose is only to identify and treat tissue damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
599  -1.0      3 HCPain    Tissue damage is not required for pain to be experienced. Using that as an excuse to disregard patient and experience is not only useless (because it doesn't help the patient), it's condescending because patients are often not able to defend their experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
604   0.0      1 patients  While it's a true statement, it seems that most doctors are only equipped to treat tissue damage, and thus will handwave away pain or tend to ascribe idiopathic causes to any pain that isn't a simple acute issue (e.g. obvious broken bone)

635   1.0      1 patients  I have a herniated disc and it's helpful to know that the pain I feel in my leg doesn't indicate that anything is wrong with the leg at all.

While it's fundamentally true, pain still occurs with minor damage (papercuts hurt a disproportionate amount compared to the damage of one as an example)

643  -1.0      0 controls  What context makes this useful? I guess if a patient were worried about permanent damage, it's useful. But I can't tell if the subtext here is "pain doesn't matter if nothing is being damaged" (which seems problematic), or, "yes, it hurts, but you might take some comfort from knowing you just need to beat the pain and probably will not have permanent injuries".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
645  -1.0      1 patients  My pain is from being hit by a car (I was a pederstrian) and suffered fractures in my neck, tissue damage in my hips and knees plus broken falangies in my hand. The pain is of course caused by tissue damage but knowing this is pointless.

655  -1.0      1 patients  It doesn't identify the cause of said pain, and leaves patients contemplating the root cause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
662   0.0      1 patients  It depends on the context. It is fact, but it often used by medical professionals in a condescending manner to communicate that the tissue damage does not exist. That said because it is fact, it can also be said in such a way that it is not condescending, if it leads to investigating not only if there is tissue damage, but if there is not what else may be causing the pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
666  -1.0      1 patients  I think that pain could come from many reasons and one of them is tissue damage. When it's true it's awful and high level of pain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
677  -1.0      1 patients  This doesn't make any sense.  Are you saying pain is okay because your body may be healthier than you think? Because if so I would choose condescending instead                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
679   0.0      1 patients  Not all pain does mean tissue damage, i know. Some pain can be nerves problems. I don't know how often this statement is true.

Can be very condescending if it poorly used.

706   0.0      1 patients  Initially it sounds like invalidation, it sounds like something someone would say to a patient with chronic pain to tell them it's all in their head (which is not inaccurate but there is a difference between people telling you to suck it up and people acknowledging that pain is controlled by the brain). Upon thinking about it a second time I can see how some people might not realize that just because something hurts doesn't mean that anything is wrong with the tissue, and just because something doesn't hurt doesn't mean the tissue is healthy, but this statement is so neutral and relies on some background information that not all patients will have, there is probably a better or more complete way to phrase this idea. You might try phrasing it more softly like "Pain is not always an accurate indicator of tissue damage".

It's not fine, it can have a profound impact on mental health, and can create distrust in the medical community to be treated like you're just fine when you've been in pain for years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
728  -1.0      0 controls  Vague on the type of pain. Muscle soreness from exercise, joint pain, and chronic muscle pain are very different in this statement. I wouldn't know if it only referred to the first or to the latter two.

771   1.0      1 patients  people can die of a ðŸ’” that is not a physical tissue damage. If stress can cause pain surely counseling could help to some extent?

Possibly then the brain cannot cope with emotion and sends out pain signals  ' just in case' fight/flight is necessary?

783   0.0      1 patients  I understand that pain is relative, but I came to the doctor because I wanted less pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
784  -1.0      1 patients  The statement is negative or leaves a lot to be explained a better statement would be pain does not directly indicate tissue damage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
787   0.0      1 patients  In a medical context the statement is appropriate, but it is somewhat confusing at first (for a layperson).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
794   1.0      1 patients  I would say, if that statement is true, that it is interesting to know. I would think that even if the tissue was not damaged, the nerves could be or a non-tissue item like bone could be damaged causing nerve issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
795   0.0      0 controls  It seems to make some sense, but in would think pain and tissue damage would be generally linked together.

You are a useless clinician because you can't find out what's wrong.

813  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  While I've known this from my days in martial arts and extreme sports, it is difficult to explain to people who haven't been active in environments where getting hurt is different to getting injured

819  -1.0      1 patients  I think it's confusing/ slightly useless because pain is different for everybody. For my brother, and most people, pain is a signal for tissue damage. For myself, it is not. Chronic pain is a disease, so yes our pain is not an accurate indicator of tissue damage. But you cannot describe pain in general this way because it ONLY associates with chronic pain patients.

826   1.0      1 patients  For someone with chronic pain like me, I know that my pain is mostly nerve based. It isn't because I hurt myself.

827   0.0      1 patients  I think a better statement would be Pain is not always an indicator. I have no tissue damage and no explanation for my pain so it makes sense to me however I had a doctor who misdiagnosed me because they didnt believe that statement and assumed it was damage. Furthermore, that statement can be used to condescend and undermine pain patients

For example, the muscle tension could be the cause for the pain.

851  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  While I agree that pain doesn't necessarily only arise from tissue damage and that nerve damage could also result in severe tissue damage without pain, I wouldn't phrase the statement that way and I don't know how much use/comfort/understanding a patient would find in that statement.

Sounds right, but really not a helpful statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
859  -1.0      1 patients  It reads as being a bit dismissive of pain as a valid indicator that something could actually be wrong, even though overall it doesn't deny that pain could indicate a problem. But it comes across as downplaying the validity of pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
861   1.0      1 patients  It's frustrating to experience pain daily, yet no current medical testing shows a structural reason for my pain. Doctors are less inclined to take me seriously because fibromyalgia is truly an invisible illness (at least where medicine is at today). Knowing there doesn't have to be tissue damage for chronic pain to exist provides some reassurance that what I go through is real.

There are many physiological, neurochemical etc. factors which come into play. For example I have had chronic pain which was likely based in tissue damage but was exacerbated because of psychological associations and/or trauma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
897   1.0      0 controls  Pain is also emotional, and can vary between cultures how it is perceived. I've even heard of people feeling more pain during a painful stimulus if they know the stimulus is coming (during shots for example).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
898  -1.0      3 HCPain    Before I had experienced chronic pain myself, as a healthcare professional,  I would have thought that it could be a helpful statement.  After expetipain for years now, I fell that state is useless, completely unhelpful. Who cares if there is visible correlatable tissue damage... knowing that does not decrease my pain level or help me sleep through my pain at night.

901  -1.0      1 patients  I have had several physicians order different scans for tissue damage in an attempt to explain the pain I experience. More often than not, there is no damage found (or in their opinion, not sufficient damage; autoimmune diseases are often mysterious), and so the physicians then approach me as though I'm either malingering or imagining things. It's very discouraging to encounter these attitudes.

923   0.0      1 patients  I have been diagnosed with Small Fiber Neuropathy via skin biopsy. With that context, knowing that pain is not linked to tissue damage can be helpful. However, without knowing the cause of the pain, that statement would come across as not helpful.

930  -1.0      1 patients  If my doctor said that to me it would not help at all unless in the context of finding a cause.

935   0.0      1 patients  It doesn't matter if there is tissue damage, if a person is in pain, they are in pain. Something is happening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
936   0.0      1 patients  I agree with the fact but I've come across doctors who have used that fact to not look for a physical root cause of my pain. I don't think that's good care.

I think there is something physical that goes on to cause chronic pain that doctors don't understand yet.

967   1.0      0 controls  If being said to someone in pain then needs to be presented in a compassionate way to ensure it doesn't sound like "blame the victim" or "you are making this up".  To me the examples of phantom pain and of people not feeling injuries while still in battle are useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
968   1.0      3 HCPain    I utilize a pain monitoring modeling to help me stay active and strong. This model I utilize as part of life, but also the way I educate my patients.

973   0.0      1 patients  Pain could be from many different things besides tissue damage.  I think nerves have a lot to do with the feelings of pain.after an injury, the tissues could be healed, but because you have not used them they could be stiff or just not wanting to move. Headaches are a pain I do not understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
974  -1.0      3 HCPain    Initially there were no signs of structural issues on my MRI so I feel as though I was mostly ignored or treated as though it was all in my head. However a new MRI a year later which I felt like I had to beg for or almost lose my ability to walk in order to have it ordered showed I had spinal cord compression. I knew there was something wrong and based on one image I was treated for 20 months as though there was nothing wrong.  I think taking this theory too far for too long can allow people to miss diagnosing something and you still need to listen to patients who know their body is better than you when they say that something has changed or something IS wrong.

I stopped going to doctors and have more recently been following the Explain Pain gang and have achieved a lot of relief on my own.

1034  1.0      1 patients  Just because you have pain in a joint or in a specific area, you may or may not have tissue damage in that area at that time. For example, I had a good deal of tissue damage in my hip joint early on in my disease process, but it was one of my least painful joints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
1036  0.0      1 patients  I understand that pain can occur without any tissue damage. It makes sense. Headaches occur with no tissue damage. Muscles hurt from time to time and it passes on it's own. But I find it confusing when I'm told, you have an observable & significant change (MRI or scan) But That doesn't account for your pain. 20 or 30% of people have that change with no pain.

1041  1.0      1 patients  Helpful because I believe it's best to stick with facts. This kind of pain is probablyÂ harder to solve, thus might cause despair. We just need to remember this pain is still valid theÂ same.Â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
1042 -1.0      1 patients  The statement would be of questionable utility to the patient, as their typical mindset is "I'm going to go to the doctor because something's wrong with my body, and they'll fix it." Because of this, at worst, it can make a patient feel like "it's all in their head" and that the doctor thinks they're malingering or crazy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
1043  1.0      1 patients  This is true, though how a patient will hear it will depend greatly on the context of the conversation, and may be very dismissive.

Pain sucks but it's information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
1060 -1.0      1 patients  I have had 25 femoral rodding surgeries, which obviously have caused tissue damage. The pain stemming from the surgeries isn't dependent on the most severe areas of tissue damage, and appears sporadic; appearing in areas without apparent tissue damage. I have osteogenesis Imperfecta for refrence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
1063  1.0      3 HCPain    I feel it is a helpful statement to reassure people that their tissue health might not be as bad as their perception of pain is. Problem is, knowing this doesn't mean your pain will go away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
1064 -1.0      1 patients  While it may be true it doesn't address any problem. I heard this statement over and over again when I was first seeking treatment.  Finally I saw a physiatrist who explain that I had a functional issue, not a structural problem.   I had seen many other doctors who told me that nothing was wrong with me because they could not point to structural damage (like an injury) on an X-ray or MRI.  I also discovered that my disability was square in the crosshairs of a political debate between physiatrists and neurologists.  It was agonizing to have to educate myself and seek care while being a ping pong ball between different camps arguing about the nature and origin of pain.  I was also told that pain could not be used as a measure of whether I was fit to return to work. (I was a hotel chef and that required a great deal of heavy lifting, working bent over, bending, and twisting).  Over time it became apparent that what had been dx as a functional disorder was actually the beginning of degenerative disease in my back and hips. It took years but we finally got some decent diagnostics. I cried with relief the first time I could see actual damage on film.                                                                                                      
1065 -1.0      0 controls  I guess i understand it as tissue may not be "damaged" but if the tissue itself is feeling pain, especially if muscles and fascia are feeling knotted, I feel they're damaged when they're hurting.

If you fixed the physical damage and there is still pain there is still a problem!

1075 -1.0      1 patients  To say its not an accurate indicator is factual, but the pain a patient is feeling indicates a serious issue. It reads as if more tissue damage = more legitimate pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
1078  1.0      3 HCPain    Both of these statements challenge the common assumptions of a large percentage of the population and contradict the practices and understandingof most, but especially, senior, health practitioners/professionals. Partly this reflects the current methods people are using to engage in public debate; which roughly is that belief is superior to fact or training/education.But I doubt that pain science will be as tough a sell as climate change, but it may take a generation or so for it to be accepted.

As an intelligent person who's had many frustrating and condescending doctor's visits over the years, I'm well aware that pain isn't always correlated to damage.

Pain is real and it is irrelevant to say that just because you don't have visible, understandable in medicine, damage it doesn't mean I am well.

Unless there is some ground truth that can be gotten then everything is relative and "not accurate" is probably more like "not completely/always accurate".

However, it's only good to hear if it's not said in a dismissive or condescending way.

1130  0.0      2 HCNoPain  I think when said to another medical professional, it can be helpful because it cuts both ways, you can have lots of pain with minor damage and lots of damage with minor pain.  When said to a patient, it seems like it would almost exclusively be used to minimize patient suffering (i.e., despite your high pain, your body is "fine")

Tissue damage is not a patient oriented outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
1138 -1.0      2 HCNoPain  I can understand this as a medical profession.

1140 -1.0      2 HCNoPain  Although pain can obviously occur without extensive trauma / damage, I believe any report of pain should be looked into before such a statement is made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
1141 -1.0      3 HCPain    I can say anything that pain is not. Pain is not an indicator of elevated creatinine. Pain is not an indicator for highest degree of education. The only time this statement actually means anything is if someone asks "is pain an accurate indicator for tissue damage"

1167 -1.0      1 patients  While I can agree with the literal statement, it would very much depend on the context it was said in. If it's just to rule out tissue damage, fine. But it sounds borderline dismissive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
1168  1.0      0 controls  We learn through life experience that damaging tissue (burns, bruises, etc) typically causes pain. However, it's important to know that there are many exceptions. You can damage tissue and lose sensation instead of having pain, or you can have nerve pinching that manifests as pain elsewhere in the body, or you can have pain associates with a harmless bodily process (gas, menstruation, etc).

1184 -1.0      0 controls  A useful fact if you're talking with scientists. But not useful to say to patients. It's like the WHO saying "there is no evidence that masks prevent coronavirus transmission." A scientist understands that lack of evidence does not mean evidence of lack. A civilian hears "masks don't prevent coronavirus transmission."

1234  0.0      1 patients  I think it could be helpful in the sense that you don't rule out the possibility of more severe internal tissue damage just because the patient reports mild/no pain. It also implies that pain could be caused by something other than tissue damage, such as nervous dysfunction. However, i think physicians hearing this could interpret to mean that a patient reporting moderate/severe pain does not have any physical illness and should be discharged without medical intervention, which would be unfortunate.

1261 -1.0      1 patients  The statement is biased, and does not cover all relevant information. Pain is not *always* an accurate indicator of tissue damage, but in some cases it IS an accurate indicator.  However, tissue damage should not be considered the standard against which we measure the validity of a condition. Intense pain can present in the absence of tissue damage, but it is still an indicator of a problem.

Surely pain and damage are correlated even if not perfectly linear?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
1264  1.0      0 controls  To know that my experience of pain doesn't inherently mean there is physical damage somewhere is reassuring. It could help me manage my perception of that experience while I wait for more information.

It makes you think that what you feel is not a precise description of what's happening, but then the reverse might also be true - when something doesn't hurt b it is causing damage. I like to understand my body so that I can be proactive in communicating with with doctors. And this statement (if true) helps to achieve that goal

1278  1.0      1 patients  With neurological issues, I sometimes need to be reminded that my pain may not necessarily mean permanent damage.

1288 -1.0      1 patients  Duh. Everyone experiences pain differently. One person freaks out at a skinned knee, another barely notices it. Why the difference? Many things, but I know from suffering pain for twenty years I can tolerate a lot, brain has adapted to cope with it. Has it also grown to expect pain? Maybe, sure. Do I have a constant reason for tissue damage?

Pain and how it affect standard of living is the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
1304 -1.0      1 patients  I would say "true."  Some people with minimal damage have a lot of pain, some with massive damage seem to feel none.  So that statement to me is true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
1307  0.0      1 patients  At first glance it can feel like a very condescending statement to a chronic pain patient, but my specialists took the time to explain that "hurt doesn't always equal harm" to show me that I can do more than I feel I can.

I'd be more interested in defining what pain is rather than what it is not.

1318 -1.0      1 patients  I have fibro and am still just super confused about how the pain manifests. I know I don't need to have tissue damage to feel pain, but I feel like there's definitely a huge correlation.
