60   -1.0      2 HCNoPain  I used to believe this statement. I understood it as the culmination of processes reaching a point at which there is enough information for action. It's kind of a buck stops here scenario (the brain), but the processes were neural.  On its own it again blames the victim it also creates.

99    1.0      1 patients  Many people are unaware that this is the case and will likely scoff at it without a thorough explanation of how and why this is a physiological fact. Most people don't realize how quickly neurological impulses reach the brain. For most people, stubbing a toe (for example) causes immediate pain. Because of the damage to my spinal cord, I experience things differently. When I stub my toe, there is a delay being the action itself and when my brain expresses pain. Sometimes that delay is significant. Often I find bruises on my arms of legs that I literally never felt at all. Or I will find a really bad bruise and press on it, but not feel any discomfort for 10 seconds or more.

123  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  I do not know what the brain "decides" (I am sarcastic now). There may be situations, where strong inhibitory processes are active, as Beecher wrote in the 1940's for survival reasons. Also Wall (1979) described three behaviours (on the relationship on injury to pain): fight, flight, help-seeking. The day after the injury pain set in, including mood changes and the desire to withdraw from social activities and food. The statement carries the risk, that pain as a meaningful function is denied, and that all kinds of pain can be treated with "just a bit of willpower", which puts the blame on the patient, if treatment does not bring the desired results                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
126  -1.0      0 controls  nothing is ever 100%, ever. when you step on a nail  with your barefoot and your reflex kicks in to get away from the source of pain, the signal that reaches the brain to indicate "danger" has not been reached before the arc reflex interneurons have signaled for the retraction of the foot. This would suggest  that there are some mechanism put into place that elicit a motor reaction prior to the brain perceiving the nociception signal. One might argue that the arc reflex system 'knows' that this circumstance will lead to pain, and in order to expedite the output of the organism and avoid further pain/damage the interneurons of the spine will send a signal to the motoneuron of the foot while simultaneously sending a signal to the brain to let it know that the individual has endured some discomfort but 'they' took care of it and now the brain can go on to out pain sensations.

I couldn't decide my way out of it.

What if we were to find out something to contradict that statement in the future?

197  -1.0      1 patients  No kidding. The brain seems pretty critical to many functions of the body... This statement makes me feel like you're saying I'm crazy, or that the pain is in my head and an altered state of thinking would be an effective treatment.

The brain decides everything, but that's an inane oversimplification of a far more complex problem.

This statement negates the importance of the nervous system.

Also, I identify as my brain and so it seems weird to say it is the brain doing these things (where am I?)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
346   0.0      3 HCPain    Again, yes, correct. But "decides" once again hints at a conscious process. External and internal factors add up to whether something is perceived as pain or not, and to what degree, that's not a decision so much as a mathematical balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
347  -1.0      1 patients  Feels dismissive. Pain is a symptom of a much larger issue, especially when there's an unknown cause. Until we know why chronic pain happens, it feels like it's "handwaving" away the real affect chronic pain has On a person

357  -1.0      1 patients  I'm thinking about the effects of microbiome, vagus nerve, GI system, and how everything is turning out to be more complex in medicine than just years ago. It seems to be an oversimplification as there are other processes seemingly involved with how the brain interacts and 'decides'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
359  -1.0      1 patients  While most of us know that all sensory experience is born in the brain, you could philosophically argue your way to a solipsistic brain in a jar reality very easily from that statement. The brain interprets signals from the body, whether damaged tissue or inflammation or hormone.

371  -1.0      1 patients  It is true but it is not helpful. All perception is decided by the brain.   Maybe use a different word, "decided" makes it sound like a conscious choice. An example could help. For instance: cut with a sharp blade may not hurt even though there is damage but a tiny paper cut is distracting for days.

382   0.0      1 patients  Obviously, the brain processes pain, but without input from the five senses, pain would probably be perceived differently. Sometimes adrenaline is strong enough after an injury that a person doesn't even feel the pain or notice their injury until after the hormone wears off.

406  -1.0      1 patients  While I may be entirely true, as can be shown with CIP patients, saying this to people in chronic pain in disingenuous.  And even if we could just turn off the pain receptors in our brains, it doesn't mean our body isn't actively attacking itself and damaging our body.

This does not validate me or solve problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
467  -1.0      1 patients  The brain isn't the only body part that plays a role in determining if pain is felt the peripheral nervous system and the spinal cord are also involved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
468   0.0      1 patients  This makes pain sound like it's all in your head.  While technically physiologically this statement is true, it also seems to downplay body pain.

480   0.0      1 patients  This is true, however, I cannot tell my brain to stop responding to the signals my body sends it. Whilst this may become helpful at some point in the future if invent a new treatment, this does not help me right now. I've tried meditation, mindfulness, etc, it's nice, relaxing, but it doesn't fix my body.

491   0.0      1 patients  The further I get in this survey, the more frustrated I feel. If a provider were to say these things to me, I might feel as if they are blaming me. I understand that there are thing the individual can reframe pain, but being challenged can be triggering. Most patients with chronic pain have spent years, decades in search of help and support from healthcare providers, friends, and family, only to have our pain dismissed by far too many. This statements can be perceived as dismissive by someone living with chronic pain.

503   0.0      1 patients  Ok. The brain controls all the systems in the body, incl obviously the nervous system, which controls how my finger feels if I accidentally burn it. There is pain. But that's the body's defense mechanism telling me to pull my hand away from the fire.   And when I have constant pain in my neck & upper back, the brain is telling me something is wrong there. It shouldn't feel this way. Is it a pinched nerve? A pulled muscle? Degenerative disc disease? Doesn't matter - the brain is making me aware of it. That doesn't mean the brain can fix it. But it may mean the brain can pinpoint where the problem is so we can try to fix it.

Can I tell my brain to ignore the pain of a hot stove?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
508  -1.0      1 patients  In the case of nerve damage and/or interruptions to pathways from different locations to the brain, it is not always possible for the brain to receive the input from a location in the body in order to interpret the stimuli.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
514  -1.0      1 patients  I feel like this distinction usually doesn't matter. If there is something going on in the body that is causing pain, I don't care what's "deciding" that it's painful, I care about addressing the cause                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
518   0.0      1 patients  It's true but I'm not sure if it's useful. I don't find "mind over matter" useful. I know that there's nothing wrong enough to need surgical treatment. Surgical treatment is contraindicated in ehlers danlos syndrome anyway. It does sound as if I should overcome the brain and no longer feel the pain since I should have more control over my brain by controlling my thought processes. I do actually use distraction as a way to deal with pain most of the time, and it does work as long as pain doesn't hit a 7 or so. I don't actually have control over it and have had very painful things happen that make other people cringe. I have had elbow and shoulder issues that I don't even feel but that cause substantial bruising and make friends squirm.   I mean, I suppose it's useful for people who don't understand that there's nothing wrong with them other than the pain and who want unnecessary surgeries to fix it- but for the most part I understand and just can't do anything about the pain in spite of knowing that it's from my brain. I'm just as frustrated as a doctor might be. I would like it to be better too.

528  -1.0      1 patients  Is this one true? I don't think it is, because your nerves are what tells your brain if you're feeling pain. So if you have that sensory input, it's not your brain causing pain, it's the nerves sensing the pain. Right? I guess I could be wrong. Seems like a rude thing to say to someone with chronic pain regardless. Even if the doctor doesn't intend it this way, it would sound like they're telling me that I'm making it up.

532  -1.0      1 patients  Pain starts in the nerves in the areas that are affected/damaged. Then those signals are sent to the brain to be interpreted.

574  -1.0      1 patients  Yes yes the brain body connection. Nerves give signals to the brain the brain says feel pain. It also tell me that things are burning and that my mast cells need to protect me.

579  -1.0      1 patients  It's a correct assessment, because if my femur breaks in half it is the nervous system (of which the brain is part of) that decides if it hurts or not. And sometimes the nervous system decides that you're in pain without any physical injury. It's all pain, with no exceptions.

643  -1.0      0 controls  That's like saying that it's the brain that decides if we see light, 100% of the time. Sure, but I'd still pinpoint the eyes as the sensing organs for light, and nerves as sensing organs for pain. And given the evidence of SFNP in e.g. fibromyalgia, this seems pertinent.

683  -1.0      1 patients  Technically this is correct. The brain interprets pain from the nerves. But this is completely condescending because there are too many situations where it doesn't matter if the brain controls the pain or not. The nerves are still causing the pain.

When describing these types of moments, it's explained as they feel the pain, they recognize it's there, but they don't respond to it. This takes immense practice. While a large part of the brain probably is responsible for the amount of pain we feel, I don't believe it is the source for 100% of our pain 100% of the time.

819  -1.0      1 patients  This doesn't sound right to me personally, but I'm not a doctor. But I think it has something to do with the pain receptors for other body parts and brain? So why is my pain all over, while someone else's pain is only in their back?

851   0.0      2 HCNoPain  Once again I think this is technically true and maybe useful but we also don't have complete control over our brain so we can't 'undecide' it doesn't hurt.

870   0.0      0 controls  I'm not an expert on pain, so I don't know. But I would at least say that the surroundings and the own mentality can influence the amount of pain. Afterall, when a child hurts themself depending on whether their parents stay calm or fall into panic mode the child will be off again playing as they see it's not that bad or start crying and screaming as it seems what happened to them must be terrible.

916  -1.0      1 patients  The brain doesn't 'decide' to be in pain in the first place. Decide places the assumption of consciousness on pain, and that consciousness generally doesn't seem to be present - if you said:"the neurological system governs our pain response" then sure, but the brain doesn't decide pain in my opinion.   And in my personal experience, consciously ignoring or deciding to not have pain has not reduced the pain resultant from my SCI and knock on neuropathy.

973   1.0      1 patients  As I said... all tissue and bones are connected to nerves which are connected to the brain.  Without this connection, you could not feel pain.  You are your brain.it is not something that is outside your being,  what other thing would tell you if something is painful.  I don'tknow Why this would even be questioned, unless I am missing something.

1018 -1.0      1 patients  The brain does not "decide" whether something hurts. It receives input and has a corresponding output to it, all within the primitive parts of the brain, far below higher intelligence.  Just the same as someone who is deaf may not perceive sound waves but still receive the mechanical pressure of displaced gas.

Some pain you can control (by thinking only) some not.

1089 -1.0      1 patients  It is a true statement from the perspective of nerves sending information to the brain which is then translated into pain or sensation or however that works.

But recurring or chronic pain, especially mystery disease pain, is in many cases an electrical problem.

1194 -1.0      1 patients  Pain is distressing because it is a signal of damage - that is how we experience it. Try telling your brain - NO, stop deciding this hurts - when it feels like your skin is literally burning off in the most sensitive and vulnerable area of your body. Pain drives us to action. When you are told there IS no action, it doesn't FUCKING STOP.

The lamp switch "decides" if its on or off, like your nociceptors do; the fuse box decides if that input is gonna be functional or not, like the brain. Yeah, 100% of all pain signals have to be processed by the brain for your to perceive pain, but the brain usually is just interpreting incoming signals from elsewhere.

1256 -1.0      1 patients  I don't agree with that. To me and I admit I am not the brightest walking around out there it feels like saying my pain is all in my head. Again. My head may interpret the pain and tell me it's pain but it receives the signals from the part that is in pain.

Like, when a security scan report shows bugs and issues, instead of acknowledging the issues and fixing them, we just turn off the security scan.

If someone breaks their leg, and while the brain is the reason pain is understood, the best course of action is fixing the leg.
