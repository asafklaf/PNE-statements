60   -1.0      2 HCNoPain  Again, creates the victim and then blames the victim.  I think that most of these statements started out with good intention - from many aspects of the reading, these statements are supposed to be about the processing of various stimuli, which involves hardware (static) and software (malleable) (for want of a better analogy). Though these statements were likely insufficient to begin with, they have become entirely other when taken on their own.

99    0.0      1 patients  Fake it till you make it, I guess? To say that pain is an opinion of the brain sounds a lot like it's a conscious choice. Different wording needs to be used without people having to do mental acrobatics to figure it out. Maybe speak about the brain as decidedly separate from a person's personal thoughts and subjective feelings. Your brain's opinions are not necessarily your personal opinions. It has nothing to do with your psychological process or ideology.

217  -1.0      1 patients  Quite offensive actually. Maybe 'technically' true from a certain medical perspective, but ultimately sets patients up for believing this to say 'you choose to be in pain'. People think not of their brains like objective organs but where their sense of self is located. Most haven't and shouldn't have to learn about their brain pathologically.

HOW MUCH pain and how you deal with the pain, those might be subjective.  Pain itself? Is not.

238  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  I see how this could be helpful, but once again, the connotations of the word "opinion" could very easily be construed to mean choice. I think many people in pain could be offended by this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
239  -1.0      1 patients  Not all pain can just be 'thought' away. I consider this language very dangerous for the mindset it produces in doctors and family/friends of the patient. It's like telling a depressed patient to 'just feel happy' - or a diabetic patient to 'just stop needing insulin'.

244   0.0      3 HCPain    It sounds really hippie-is, but interesting and good for further building.

263  -1.0      1 patients  This could be a dangerous statement without proper education backing it up.  People suffering chronic pain can be very delicate.  Teaching that you can find meditative ways to manage pain, is very different than saying "It's all in your head, make it feel like butterflies". Semantics in every message is vital.

320  -1.0      3 HCPain    Although there are mental techniques to help block out pain, implying that pain is an opinion, of the brain or otherwise, makes it sound like you are blaming the patient for their pain and again invalidating their experience.

399  -1.0      1 patients  While some people might react to this with understanding, many do not and won't. Pain, when you're in it, is not an opinion. It's an opinion of the body and brain, which is a part of the body. Yes, there are ways to change this "opinion", but telling that to a chronic pain patient once again, will make them feel as if they are not being heard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
405   1.0      1 patients  Again I would be interested and want to know more. However until behaviour is unlearned people need treatment for how they feel pain right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
406  -1.0      1 patients  Again, this is about more than pain for millions of people.  It's about stopping our bodies from destroying themselves                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
409  -1.0      1 patients  This sounds like a Facebook post in an anti-vaxx Mom group                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
414  -1.0      1 patients  Neuroplasticity is real. I have had successful treatment though for the physical causes of chronic pain which were life-changing. Changing my brain's opinion mattered a lot less than surgical repair of organs. Appendicitis doesn't need a brain's opinion changed so much as treatment. I find this statement grossly overgeneralising.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
419  -1.0      1 patients  This is just telling people that their pain is all in their head.

442  -1.0      1 patients  Pain is a fact it's not something that's just going to go away. When you say that most of your patients discount you almost immediately because you sound like an idiot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
447  -1.0      1 patients  Again, it's all in my head? Why don't you just tell me chronic pain should be in the DSM V as something to be fixed with therapy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
448  -1.0      1 patients  That statement is quite frankly bullshit.

449  -1.0      3 HCPain    Christ... this is they type of statement that keeps people from being provided adequate treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
456  -1.0      3 HCPain    If a doctor said this I'd consider them to be uninformed and uneducated about my condition. For me, this is not the case. Daily joint dislocation is painful and my brain cannot 'unlearn' that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
458  -1.0      1 patients  I would not return to this provider. This feels like blame is being placed on me.

463  -1.0      1 patients  This feels like something someone has never been in pain says. If you break your arm, you cannot decide your arm no longer hurts.

481  -1.0      1 patients  I think these questions were designed for post recover from traumatic injuries with chronic pain as a symptom because when you dislocate a rib or your hip pops out it becomes much less of an opinion and more of your brain translating that you just dislocated something.

502   0.0      1 patients  I'm open to the idea. But so far most people I've come across that are into this line of thinking haven't had real pain. They have something minor and opine about how they overcame it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
503  -1.0      1 patients  The brain doesn't have opinions. Something either is or isn't.

508  -1.0      1 patients  This is factually untrue and could be damaging in multiple ways if shared with any patient, whether they experience chronic pain or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
510   0.0      1 patients  It's a nice thought to have, but if your pain is coming from something like constant joint dislocations etc....this seems insane.

518  -1.0      1 patients  I'm going to need research papers on that. A lot of them. Why do doctors never share the journal articles??? I'm just as strongly anti opioid as any rational person, but I'm not convinced that treating a medical problem like a psychiatric problem is the way to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
524  -1.0      1 patients  This is like the other one I spoke about in the sense that it almost makes you feel like you've done something wrong. Less so in this one though. Emphasis being on brain function would be helpful. The word opinion is what does it. Addiction works because many people logically know that addiction is something that's hard, but possible, to fight. An opinion feels more like a choice you're making casually, so it feels semi dismissive.

528  -1.0      1 patients  It's like saying depression is a choice. "Just choose to be happy" except here it is "just choose to not be in pain anymore" or "just don't have a migraine anymore" or even "just stop being sick," as of it is a choice.

532  -1.0      1 patients  Pain starts in the nerves in the areas that are affected/damaged. Then those signals are sent to the brain to be interpreted. I don't believe this is rooted in science either.  It seems dismissive.

540  -1.0      1 patients  There are ways to lower pain, but it is not an opinion (effectively saying that it's not real). You can't tell some who broke a bone or is healing from surgery that their pain is an opinion, so why would it be different for chronic pain?

558  -1.0      3 HCPain    How can you justify saying this to a patient? Is a collagen disorder just my brain's opinion? Is a migraine my brain's opinion? This is worse than nonsense: it suggests one can just choose to not be in pain. We pain patients are so sick of this. It seems like you're once again trying to blame the patient for the pain.

643  -1.0      0 controls  I didn't think my way into my chronic pain, and I didn't think my way out. I changed my diet based on evidence of chronic health issues, including my medical history and genetics, and that was what resolved the pain (and reintroduced the pain when I went off-diet, either knowingly or by accident). Sometimes pain means there is a problem, and your brain is correctly diagnosing that an issue exists without correctly pinpointing the source (because the effects are wide-spread).

721   0.0      2 HCNoPain  Pain is not an opinion but a series of neuro-chemical reactions which are then mediated by the opnions and responses of the frontal lobe. Pain can be managed by managing one's expectations and perceptions, but this management does not eliminate the sensory neurochemical signal.

Choosing not to feel chronic pain would be a life skill that takes years to perfect, not a month course you can listen to and fix yourself.

794  -1.0      1 patients  Not at all accurate. Like my comment before about being unable to unlearn pain, this is the same. Your opinion on the amount of pain can be different from someone but it is still pain. You can also be trained to ignore, downplay, or work through the pain. In the end, the pain is still there.

804  -1.0      1 patients  It's frustrating to me as a person who deals with chronic pain when doctors imply that your brain is responsible for your pain. Not because its not true. It is.

819  -1.0      1 patients  No offense to the psychologists/  psych researchers, but statements like these are why I hate working with therapists., people who know pain but don't really know it unless they've experienced it. There's a lot of good in CBT but NEVER tell a person pain is "in your head" or "an opinion". I don't understand what that even means... it sounds like you are telling me that brain has decided that it wants my body to be in pain and that I have no control of my mind? Am I crazy now? Honestly this is kinda hurtful as I have worked very hard towards pain recovery and establishing a strong mentality.

I'd also bring up something about learning to tell the difference between chronic pain that can be ignored, and pain that is alerting to danger or an obvious medical problem that needs to be attended to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
847   1.0      1 patients  I do think pain could be an opinion.  Like when it's really cold out, I can either shiver and have a tight back, or I can lower my shoulders and breathe deeply and forget about the cold weather.   We feel pain out of fear as well. Once fear is removed, the pain also melts away.  It's all about understanding what's causing the pain and deciding if we going to change our mind about that cause, or allow it to still hurt us.   Like I mentioned with my dilating above in the comments.

861  -1.0      1 patients  Again, while this may be technically true, it feels dismissive. If you can just decide not to experience pain, people will think you're just making the pain up in the first place. If your pain response can be unlearned, it would require a lot of work to train it. That needs to be emphasized. I can't just decide at this moment not to experience pain and expect it to go away. This statement, if not further explained, gives the impression that one can just snap out of it. That's not the truth.

Again, I'm not an expert, so assuming there might be some truth in the statement, I would guess it might depend on the type of pain but when it comes to wounds pain isn't simply an opinion of the brain.

902  -1.0      1 patients  I'm not aware of any studies that successfully show how to "change the brain's opinion" on pain processing.   In my experience, statements like this are often directed at patients with chronic pain illnesses that aren't well understood. As long as the underlying science of their conditions remain vague, their brain and/or the patient's psychology can be blamed for their suffering. Once the underlying cause of the condition is found, I think it's much harder to accuse patients of malingering or having a maladaptive brain.

936  -1.0      1 patients  Pain is not an opinion, it's an alarm bell going off. It's something telling you that something is wrong. It may or may not be a false alarm.

943  -1.0      1 patients  Again, comes off as meaning "cognitive" vs biological function of an organ. That this is an opinion - changing your mind is about influencing someone's thoughts.

It's trash and anybody who says it is saying they have no idea what it's like

Could possibly be useful in one discussion about the role of the brain, in the larger context of exploring the pain experience, but not as a singular approach

973  -1.0      1 patients  If pain is an opinion, then your nerves are not workin right.  If that were true, then going back to the question about pain signaling you that there is a problem / you are in danger, how could you ever trust your brain to warn you. Example:  if I slipped on my kitchen floor and my hand cane down on a hot stove burner, my nerves would quickly signal to my brain... danger, danger...and I would quickly remove my hand.  If my brain had the opinion that it wanted to teach me a lesson and not let me know my hand is burning, I would be in big trouble.  It is always the nerves and the brain, which is why so many diabetics get in trouble when they have nerve damage in their feet.  The nerves don't work, they can't feel pain, and the have a worse injury.

When im in pain i need empathy and Help, not lifestyle suggestions. 99% of us are aware that those things are important and do not want to be reminded it feels like being told we aren't doing good enough and reiterates the idea of pain being our fault.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
1008 -1.0      1 patients  It's like telling depressed people to put on make up to feel better.  If this statement were true, why don't we tell hospital patients that we are doing away with sedatives because it's just a change of mind to cope with pain.

1064 -1.0      1 patients  Pain is not an opinion, not unless the patient has the tools to choose differently.  Pain is a *conclusion* of the brain. With different input the brain can reach a different conclusion and produce different output.  The way I remind myself of this point is to say "pain is inevitable, suffering is optional."

1112 -1.0      3 HCPain    At-best, this might be an opening line for an article on some for of tolerance-building or long-term desensitization treatment. At which point more information is needed about when/where/how to proceed. At the same time, I can just imagine a physician giving this lecture to a cancer patient/burn patient/bear mauling victim and I just want to punch them, both for the insensitivity as well as the condescention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
1120 -1.0      1 patients  This statement also invokes feelings of anger. It makes me feel as if I'm not believed.

1206  0.0      0 controls  Seems a bit too easy. When my fingers touch fire, the opinion is correct and too acute to be re-evaluated. On chronic pain, the issue seems to be a bit more about acceptance and numbing than opinions. What I don't like is the gist that it becomes quickly a person's own fault that their brain has the wrong opinions. Presented like this it sounds so *easy* to tell your brain that it should change its opinion. People feel guilty for having pain then.

1278 -1.0      1 patients  Let's worry less about changing my mind and worry more about the root cause of my pain. If I want to re-frame my thinking, I'll call my psychiatrist. Again, "If your pain doesn't improve, it's your fault. This is all on you, so I can avoid having to deal with prescription opioids."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
1285 -1.0      1 patients  Even if this were true, most people don't have the emotional or physical resources to fully manage their pain. I've finally been able to deal with my chronic pain because I have more time to devote to physical therapy since the COVID pandemic began.

1290 -1.0      1 patients  "Interpret pain differently" would be more accurate and helpful than "change your mind" since the phrase implies that feeling pain is a conscious choice.
