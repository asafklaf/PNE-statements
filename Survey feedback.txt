13    1 patients  I'm not sure there is going to be a good one size fits all playbook here.  It may have to be tailored to different pain sources, and even during different phases.  Someone in the diagnosis phase would have to be treated differently than someone who has a diagnosis, and is now in treatment phase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
21    1 patients  I feel like these statements should have been more like true or false.

68    2 HCNoPain  I am not sure I understand the point of all these questions as it feels like they are being biased to challenge many helpful narratives commonly used?

104   1 patients  I have suffered gout flares in several parts of my body for four months, and I do not believe it is "all in my mind" or just my brain.  My jaw, shoulders, wrists, knees and even arm muscles are sore and swollen, and only respond to certain medication.

134   1 patients  It is very demeaning when anyone, esp. healthcare professionals, imply that pain is "all in your head". It is not. It's very real. Stop sugarcoating it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
140   1 patients  I have been living with chronic daily pain for 16 years now and have been to a few pain centers and various doctors seeking help to merely be able to function. I am not interested in just throwing medication at it but that is always their first assumption. Being treated like a drug seeker instead of being seen as a person with legitimate medical issues makes matters much worse for me.

The impact chronic pain had on my mental health and general well-being has been significant - compassionate treatment goes a long way when you feel like you're facing a Sisyphean battle

238   2 HCNoPain  I have also read some interesting discussion around the phrase "pain caratrophizing". I find the phrase to be an accurate use of words, so perhaps appropriate for research for its ease of use and clarity, but I have not found it helpful for clinical use. Once again, too easy to be misinterpreted. I find "pain related worry/fear" to be useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
241   1 patients  I want to hear that my pain exists, and that they want to help me find ways to overcome it.  I want to know that they aren't secretly rolling their eyes at this drama queen coming in years talking about this problem and that.  I want to know they actually believe I'm not here for the drugs they try to throw at me to shut me up because I don't want medical painkillers I want answers.

247   3 HCPain    I have cervical Dystonia. To this day I feel that if I had been treated more conservatively with Physio and PNe I would be in a much better place. Instead I was given opioids, Botox and antidepressants from the get go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
250   3 HCPain    Too many of these phrases can be misunderstood as blaming the patient for their own pain. Try to word things as the brain needing to change how it process a signal, instead of the brain being wrong or the patient being at fault.

277   1 patients  There are some areas where wording could be tweaked to help the patients better understand your meaning without taking offense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
285   1 patients  I appreciate the opportunity and hope I'm not sounding like a Karen, but it is exceptionally hard to live with this and not be defensive as we are often told it's all in our head by doctors who do not understand or even care to understand. It's scrappy and it damages trust and confidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
299   1 patients  It would seem that the snippets you've chosen from your sources think chronic pain sufferers are mental cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
307   1 patients  Ignoring pain doesn't make the problem go away. Mindfulness and meditation only gets you so far.

It's not a lifestyle choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
311   1 patients  The medicine of 100 years from now would embarrass the clinicians of today (if we make it as a species).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
320   3 HCPain    I have struggled a lot in the past with doctors talking down to me. Part of this is being a woman, I have noticed that my complaints of pain have often been shrugged off as either normal or emotional issues. I have found a doctor that I have been with for the past eight years that knows I'm a nurse and talks to me on that level. She also knows that I'm fairly knowledgeable about my condition and often asks me for updates or any concerns. She has set up specialist appointments on my recommendations based on her research into EDS as well as my extensive knowledge and experience with it. I have since moved many towns over, but I still drive 30min for my appointments with her. If I move further away, I will still commute. I've never before had a physician who talks to me on my level and trusts my insights and knowledge about my own situations.

342   1 patients  Sufferers of chronic pain are use to condescending and invalidating statements. Sometimes, the psychological toll of feeling misunderstood and/or disbelieved can be worse than the pain itself.

I likely have an ASD and have degrees in psychology, philosophy, and behavior analysis, and so I'm probably not the best person to read statements related to learning and perception...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
347   1 patients  Dismissive statements that pain is an "opinion" don't take into account the psychological impacts and day-to-day impact Chronic pain has.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
358   1 patients  The regulations in the United states on opioids is awful for people with chronic pain. My does was cut 66% last year and I suffer so much every day. I wish the fda here understood that people have pain. I have ms and my pain meds are at the bare minimum for but the government's decided maximum. Who are they to decide how much pain I have?! Also pharmacists here believe they are doctors and decide when is appropriate for you to fill your medications and they're not medical physicians. I dont need a pharmacist telling he believes my physician is over prescribing me and then they decide to hit fill your medication. Also, not being able to fill Xanax and pain medication is not fair. Both anxiety and chronic pain are conditions! Why must I choose one over the other!l thank you!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
359   1 patients  As a patient who has experienced chronic pain for months at a time, with shorter periods in between where I do not experience pain, I would disagree (in my own limited experience) with some of these statements. When my pain goes, I often don't even notice for a little while because I'm just getting on with life. That doesn't feel like an addiction to pain. I have had a course of CBT and have worked to let go of much of the emotional link to my pain, but it hasn't reduced the intensity of pain or changed it in any way. These statements are hard to hear as a patient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
360   1 patients  I would be extremely offended if any medical profession asked me most of these questions. To me it would imply that they think I am making up my pain and that my body is perfectly functional and it's all some construct in my head. I think many people that experience chronic pain have had times where medical professionals doubted their conditions or severity and these statements are just more of that in different words.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
364   1 patients  These statements make me wonder if our perception of them is influenced or biased by prior experience with medical practitioners and the ways they have talked about pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
370   1 patients  Unless the doctor has actually lived with chronic pain, most of the above statements are super offensive if coming from an able bodied person. Living with pain or without (having experienced both) is unimaginable until you go through it. Needs more empathy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
371   1 patients  I am using "pathway through pain". I am finding it too generalized. Pain from a 10year old back injury requires a different approach to osteoarthritis. The session that suggested that stretching my back could help the pain in my arthritic feet was pointless. I would suggest an introduction to highlight that not all sections would be applicable to all patients.

387   1 patients  These all sound extremely condescending. In fact most of these sound like what my "pain" hospital team told me, which ended up giving me trauma and anxiety from not being believed, and being told that pain is mental, not physical. It's horrible and is a great source of worry for chronic pain patients.

425   2 HCNoPain  I personally would be very careful using all these terms with patients. They are in pain, and don't need providers to invalidate the pain while trying to explain it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
431   1 patients  I get where doctors are coming from on the 'pain is from the brain' thing, but it sounds too much like 'it's all in your head and you need to suck it up'.  I find it helps to talk about parts of the brain causing pain, it makes it sound less like the doctor is calling you crazy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
434   1 patients  Many of these statements are philosophical in nature or an understanding of biology (your brain perceived sensation therefore pain is all in your head) They would not be helpful to me.

456   3 HCPain    I think some of these statements may be useful for patients with specific conditions, e.g. drug addiction. For someone with EDS these statements are largely useless and unhelpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
458   1 patients  I have had negative experiences being told I'm imagining my symptoms, they're all in my head, or this is a usual feeling that I'm exaggerating or being too sensitive to. This lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. For example, when I had menstrual cramps so bad I couldn't move I was told that was normal. Years later someone finally decided to look into why that might be and lo and behold I've got PCOS and IBS which were both contributing to my severe abdominal pain. Because of this experience I am particularly sensitive to any implication that I'm exaggerating or not telling the truth, or that I'm in any way responsible for my symptoms.

Telling me why my brain perceives pain does not help anything and feels condescending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
478   1 patients  I have a whole list of diagnoses. Over the last couple year's I have read about the brain connections and would like to know about it. Thank you for you work!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
480   1 patients  Whilst 100% of the time the brain decides whether something hurts, most of us are not Buddhist monks with such full control over our bodies as to change our body temperature, we know how pain works, the nerve sends a signal to the brain, the brain creates an unpleasant sensation, however, that doesn't mean there's anything we can do about that. Someone being repeatedly punched in the arm would not be blamed for their arm hurting, why are chronic pain patients blamed for their chronic pain?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
481   1 patients  The most important thing to do is to acknowledge that the person is in pain, if you want to say these statements and not be insulting make sure that you let them know that you understand that their pain is real and that there are two components of it. One is the cause of the pain (dislocated shoulder) and the other is the translation of said pain (brain telling you it hurts). Then if you have recomendations for non medicated treatments (which this seems to be advising) you let them know of the function of the brain in relation to pain from there. You always need to let them know that their pain is real when talking to someone with EDS, then you can say more

494   1 patients  Most of these statements are horrible things many of us have heard from doctors and all of which stem from the sad history of the "hysteria" diagnosis which is today "we can't find anything wrong so you must be mental". And we're not willing to be treated like this anymore.

513   1 patients  It is insulting to say that pain is only in our minds. Much pain is a result of nerve signals that can't be shut out.

Many doctors don't believe the pain is as bad as it is and that is frustrating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
520   1 patients  Over the years, I have been to many doctors and most of them are dismissive and condescending. They don't listen and often show impatience and a callous disregard for suffering. The ones who have been helpful acknowledge the real experience of pain and the limits of medicine to help. They present options and downsides to help me understand their recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
524   1 patients  Verbiage is incredible important. One of the biggest things that I've found a lot of people with chronic pain issues (myself included) struggle with is guilt. We have to deal with being a burden to everyone around us, as well as often being unable to balance our lives in a timely or effective manner. So the idea that these things we deal with, the pain we deal with, is something that we're basically doing to ourselves only adds to the guilt and stress. That said, I know that the brain likes pathways and patterns and so it's easy for chronic pain to repeat when it shouldn't. There needs to be a balance in the language. A way to give control, not blame (cause I know that's not the intention).

I'm fighting hard to get diagnosis to explain new symptoms, not because I care if it's EDS/MS/myasthenia gravis/etc., but knowing what it is allows me to take proper actions to improve my situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
543   1 patients  If a doctor said nearly any of these to me, I'd immediately find another doctor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
544   1 patients  My pain comes from inflammation in my spine which is causing continuous damage.  When the inflammation is low, the pain goes away and no damage is done.  I agree that the pain is recognized by my brain but that doesn't matter if pain equals damage.

Although I've been dealing with symptoms for 20+ years, I was diagnosed and put on clinical treatment for pain only months ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
555   1 patients  Please continue to research.

557   1 patients  Don't dumb it down. Don't make it seem like it's an option. Keep in mind that you are talking to people who are in so much pain all the time that they would happily cut off some fingers to make it go away. Allow people to understand the processes in a educational way and not in an analogy kind of way. Do remind them that their pain is validated and real.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
558   3 HCPain    These suggested statements will likely do nothing but increase despair. Don't even bother to see pain patients if you're not going to treat the pain. These "explanations" are absolutely insulting and infuriating, and we hear them all the time! They don't make pain any better! Who cares where it comes from when one's life is controlled by one's pain. Whoever thinks this rationalizing is helpful is part of the problem. Chronic pain is often devastating and can lead to suicide. Statements like this make patients question their sanity and that of their doctors. Pain doesn't care about platitudes. Treat the pain, people! Help people reclaim their lives! Don't give them yet more reasons to lose hope! My goodness, this approach is problematic on every level unless and until the damn pain is treated. Chronic pain is a terrible experience, and failing to acknowledge that and treat the pain is worse than anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
574   1 patients  The reason why most people with EDS are upset or nonchalant in appointments is because we feel like we aren't being heard and we have so much more useful information to share and we never get asked. So thanks for asking this time. Questions for people with EDS should be written with someone with EDS. Surgeries are very dangerous for us and tend not to be a permanent solution since or bodies continue to be overly stretchy. We also don't heal well after injury and we have minor injuries constantly from subluxations. Our bodies also require stronger doses of certain medications because we also process things differently. Local and general anesthetics tend to not work at all or very little on people with EDS. Most of the EDS patients send more time trying to explain our condition and very little on treatment. We are pushing for a change. Thank you for your time!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
577   1 patients  I live in a world that believes that dependence on a pain medication is addiction and that is WRONG. Pain killers allow me to function and be LESS of a burden on my friends, family, and society as a whole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
579   1 patients  Thank you for looking into improving the way we talk about pain. I truly hope it helps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
585   1 patients  Of the things that are true here, I fail to see any that are useful in any way to a patient. The way they are presented seems cold, uncaring, annoyed and apathetic.

591   1 patients  As a chronic pain patient I find a lot of these statements to be similar to what health professionals have said to me when they did not want to give me medical treatment, when everything in their communication with me seemed to express that they were not taking my medical problems seriously. I think they are harmful statements used by people who think you're making it up, it can't be as bad as you say, you're just not trying hard enough to be healthy. Therefore the language used in this form does not feel strong enough to me. I want to say something stronger than just "useless", more like "dangerous".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
603   1 patients  Many of these statements are highly concerning and appear to set up the patient for blame for their pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
604   1 patients  Many doctors get frustrated because they have trained so hard and long and yet cannot "help" a patient. Instead of being humble and admitting they need help, doctors feel that the patient is somehow insulting them by not getting better, and so they blame the patient or minimize the patient's experience to protect their own self-image.

607   1 patients  if some of these statements are true - and they could be I'm not a doctor - then they would have to be told to patients with a lot more context.

643   0 controls  I got sicker than normal for about two to three weeks after visiting doctors when I had fibro. I lost my confidence in my ability to care for myself effectively, because of subtle messages that my doctors weren't taking my input seriously. Since I trusted them, I struggled to take my input seriously as well even when I was close to unable to work my desk job. I got better when I stopped seeing doctors and focused exclusively on self-education and self-care. My conclusion is that doctors lack the time and mental energy to treat chronic pain patients. We really need a new discipline to treat us - chronic wellness coaches, or something. I love being pain-free again, but I resent the money I spent trying to follow my doctor's advice and I resent the hundreds of hours of time I spent studying medicine without a degree or trainingbecause my doctors weren't educated or up to date. I wish I could have given that time to my children instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
662   1 patients  Thank you for looking for perspective. As I said with many of these, context matters. Also a person's level of knowledge of biological science may impact their decisions. I am highly educated in biological science and work closely with medical professionals that have chronic pain themselves, so my context may be much more neutral than those who do not separate fact from emotion as easily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
663   1 patients  Most of these are interesting but need more explanation to fully understand and criticize them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
671   3 HCPain    Pain is subjective. Trying to define it for another individual is typically not helpful unless it is followed by advice or useful techniques to help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
677   1 patients  I have encountered the attitudes in this survey before and they do a huge disservice to pain patients.  I read an article pondering the question of why some pain patients commit suicide and what can be done and I will tell you that statements like the ones in this survey are why.  I tried to explain until the survey made me so angry.  Have you ever taken a pill for a headache or injury? Taken novacaine at the dentist? Why would you do that if pain is imaginary? And get those pains are trivial compared to the chronic pain that many people experience.  Do you know my body has not felt a sensation of relaxation. For about ten years now. Not even for a moment after a hard day of work.  It is just constant burning stiffness and soreness. That is on a good day and with a pain patch and medication for breakthrough pain.  On a bad day I close my door and turn on a fan so my children can't hear me moaning because I cannot stop the sound from escaping no matter how hard I try.  Have you ever even experienced pain that is so great that your body is shaking and your heart is racing and you are sweating? I am guessing not. Thankfully I have a compassionate pain management doctor. They first words he said to me when I told him of my diagnosis are "you are lucky you found me".   And I know it.

702   1 patients  I think any conversation about the causes of pain has to acknowledge that pain is terrifying and excruciating in its own right.  My TMJ is not life threatening at all but it js excruciating and has a huge effect on my quality of life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
706   1 patients  If you are talking to people who suffer with chronic pain, they have been told repeatedly by others that their problems aren't real and they need to just suck it up. Those who live with chronic pain often (and rightly) have a learned response to shut down and stop listening to people who are basically telling them that their problems are not real and "all in their head" and ultimately suggesting that they could just decide to not be in pain if they really wanted to. They have been blamed and guilted and shamed for a condition they have not had any control over often for years before they figure out what exactly is wrong. With many of the example phrases here you are faced with a problem that is like the opposite of Batesian mimicry- despite having good and helpful intentions you may end up resembling one of those poisonous bootstrappers. Obviously it's going to vary from individual to individual and I don't know how this information is going to be delivered, but as a generality I think if you can signal fairly clearly that a person's subjective experience of pain is always valid regardless of it being "all in their head" or something that is learned etc, it would be helpful for your audience and allow them to stay engaged without getting defensive. It would be good also to cushion the idea of pain being learned and therefor possible to unlearn in an acknowledgement that a person would need help and guidance to unlearn it. Basically just try to be mindful of when you could accidentally sound like you are blaming someone who suffers from chronic pain for their situation or imply that they want to be that way and try to signal that you know they are doing their best already.
715   1 patients  While I value the mind-body connection in relation to pain, I believe in the organic nature of pain.

751   1 patients  This survey was exhausting and I truly hope these are not statements used towards patients or to teach anyone what to say to someone in pain. I've spent years in pain and honestly the cavalier way these statements were made was insulting.  I appreciate the sentiment behind the survey but execution really needs some work. You are surveying people who have suffered and have probably been treated poorly or ignored. Empathy goes a long way. Sincerity goes even further.

771   1 patients  I am very grateful for the insight this survey has brought to me. I feel what I really believed has come to the fore, a weight has been lifted and I can help myself, as many people with fibromyalgia do, but only physically and dietary.

780   1 patients  I have vulvadynia which my answers are concerning, but I also have recurring neck pain, but this is much more manageable and only concerns me once or twice a year. The answers about pain that I responded about vulvadynia do apply for the pain I feel with my neck though they are in different locations.

794   1 patients  Like lots of things in life, chronic pain is often associated with the 1% of negative reports out there. So many people suffer through chronic pain because of the stigma associated with it and experiences they receive while seeking care. Like mental health, this needs to be normalized to get people the help they need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
802   3 HCPain    I have had recurrent episodes of knee pain for about 20 years on and off, when you ask about length of time for pain, it's not clear whether or not you mean constant pain.

804   1 patients  If the goal of this survey is to better understand how to talk to patients about pain, my advice is to validate the experience. It's upsetting to me when doctors disregard how badly I'm struggling. The most important skill a doctor can have when it comes to patients with chronic pain is to listen. It's healing to be heard. Learning techniques to change your brain's response to pain can be helpful, but putting an emphasis on understanding how taxing pain can be is important. It establishes trust and partnership, making brain-training techniques more effective.

819   1 patients  I think it would be better if we started discussing chronic pain as the disease that it is and not try to compare it to people without pain. You don't compare cancer to a bad flu... its unrealistic, so why is chronic pain being compared unrealistically? I found alot of the statements confusing becuase of this. Best of luck with your reaseach and I hope my comments will be helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
820   1 patients  The longer the pain has been active, the less likely it is to be resolved.

828   1 patients  Tired of hearing all these statements that make it seem like it's all in our head and we can just think differently and it will go away.  After 20 plus years of constant pain believe me I have tried to think it away, distract myself etc and I really wish it worked.  I feel worse trying and believing it will work and then feel foolish for having such hope.

If the conclusion is that someone actually has physical issues, then they need to be referred to the proper channels to help them fix this issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
855   1 patients  Well, unless you actually teach the methods of controlling pain this is not helpful at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
859   1 patients  Maybe in a larger context a lot of these phrases could seem acceptable. Pulled out and on their own, however, many seem like just validation for medical practitioners to discount or dismiss complaints of pain, which ??particularly as a woman ? has happened many times where, because I didn't feel pain strong enough, they dismissed the possibility of an actual problem (which later was found to be there). Which isn't an uncommon experience. While it's good to advocate impartiality, being impartial doesn't mean invalidating, but a lot of these phrases seem to be more invalidating than distancing.

873   1 patients  The labels provided didn't feel useful or accurate to me. I wish I had one that said "accurate" or "wrong" because although these all come from sciemce, the phrasing can make them feel more accurate to my experience or it can be a mental model that doesn't match mine.

If this survey was published into r/neuroscience for the purpose of getting a biased sample audience (if you wanted answers from people interested in neuroscience), then you are probably hearing a lot of skepticism about these statements. But if this wasn't the intention, I'm sorry for skewing your results!

935   1 patients  I had a doctor tell me that at least I am "used to the pain." I am used to it in that I deal with it every day, but that does not mean that it doesn't hurt. It doesn't mean that it keeps me from doing things i want to do, or just simply live like people without pain live. I think doctors who do not experience chronic pain have no way of really understanding what we feel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
938   1 patients  I've marked a lot of those statements are 'useless', but almost all of them would be valuable for indicating that the medical professional making them should be avoided.

979   1 patients  I am prediabetic and have developed SFN in my feet that has expanded up into my shins. It started in one big toe, then the other and then progressed up my feet. I originally thought it was because, as a teacher, I stand on concrete floors for 8 hours a day for 22 years. Burning feelings started 2 years ago. At times my feet "feel" cold even when they aren't. The worst sensation is my feet will feel cold and wet, with neither of those being true. Sometimes compression socks or wrapping my feet help. I have also been perscribed gabapentine. It helps with pain but not the tingling and numbness.

985   2 HCNoPain  As an occupational therapist in the hospital, I worked with patients who had acute or acute on chronic pain. The two messages I focused on was 1) pain is normal after [your procedure] - you are going to experience the "pain of recovery" but we are going to do this together and if your pain is ever too great, we will stop (and then follow through on that promise-have to build trust) AND #2 and most important, "your body wants to move, and do, and recover" I'm here to help you move and do safely so that you can get home and back to the things that are important to you. So the emphasis is on giving the client control, recovery, future imaging, and some control. My clients had good functional results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
994   0 controls  As someone who has dealt with vulvodynia and has struggled to be taken seriously, some of these statements may make me defensive when spoken by a medical professional. I have been told by two doctors that I was subconsciously causing myself pain making me unable to have a sexual relationship with my partner. Hearing something like "pain is learned and therefore can be unlearned" reminds me of doctors telling me to relax because it's all in my head. Obviously that's true, because our brain is ultimately what tells parts of our body that something hurts, but specifically when dealing with this type of pain, physicians tend to use that phrase when they seem to be almost blaming the patient for the position they're in.

1005  1 patients  All most of us want is to be listened to with empathy, believed, and given Proper medical care with plans of action. Short term quick fix pain relief is also important to help us get on the right path.

1014  1 patients  The best wording for these situations, that I personally have found to be helpful, is sentences like "Pain is a really common experience, but your pain will be unique to you; No one can tell you how it feels, and you are the expert on your own experience; We will find a way to work with and towards healing your pain that suits you as well as makes sense to you; It is not your fault that you are experiencing this, and your emotional as well as your physical needs should be tended to; We will work this out together; you can decide how we proceed with your pain; there is a wealth of information available to you, however I understand that this can be overwhelming; it is important to go at your own pace; your body has learned a particular pain cycle, so it is possible for it to unlearn it with time"

1041  1 patients  Pain is a tricky subject. Just because we suffer from it, doesn't mean we should ignore the possibility we can improve only by training our minds.?But we should also consider the more physical treatments.?Even if doctors haven't?diagnosed you yet. It might even be a new disses that has no name.? A psychological treatment?might have its own?side effect just like any pill has.? Therefore, we need to focus?on what we know and keep an open mind. We need to support those?in pain and try not to reflect too much on them. Our pain has a different?experience than theirs.? We should not underestimate others' suffering.?

They can also be used to justify discrimination and mistreatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
1071  1 patients  General statements like these are colored differently based on context and are therefore usually going to lead to more harm/patient distrust than good. If they dont believe their provider is going/willing to treat them they are going to either find a new provider or give up entirely and neglect themselves.

1112  3 HCPain    Attempting to evaluate the response to a single sentence without context is very difficult at best. Even moreso when addressing a topic fraught with political, emotional, and philosophical baggage such as pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
1120  1 patients  I have struggled with getting medical professionals to listen to and believe me when I talk about my pain experiences. It has happened so often and caused such harm to me that I dread every doctor's appointment and experience a major emotional shift just to prepare myself for what happens about 85% of the time--that I'll be dismissed outright. I live in the United States where seeing any doctor, but especially a specialized doctor, is very expensive. I have so much medical debt from doctors who did nothing to help me and that also has a negative impact on my emotional health. More important than anything is for a patient to be able to trust their provider. If that trust isn't there or is broken, communication about pain will be very difficult or impossible. Providers need to trust their patients when they speak about their own experiences, and patients need to be able to trust that their providers believe what they're saying.

1138  2 HCNoPain  I think there is still some work to do, none of these phrases are comprehensive nor completely accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
1143  3 HCPain    A nice demonstration of the current "brain-centrism". We had in the past the center of the so-called vital force in the liver, then the heart, the lungs, and now in the almighty brain. As a chronic pain and nevertheless healthcare provider, I may have a better connection with a patient in pain, but first and foremost because I can tell him/her that if the pain is an output signal from his/her brain, that brain is only a receptive and integrative center, and not a decider. The output is normal according to the input signals, the brain has nothing to do with it, it just makes the maths and gives the bill. As long as we'll continue to believe that the brain has a power to decide or to give an opinion by its own, we'll be trapped in esoteric thinking with a scientific dress..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
1156  2 HCNoPain  My biggest sticking point with some chronic pain patients is that many of them construct an identity around being in pain, and therefore any attempt to address or relieve pain is an assault on their identity rather than the correct and appropriate medical response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
1158  3 HCPain    Not all pain is a result of an attitude. You cannot always just will away pain and a lot of those statements may lead people to think that all pain can end just by thinking it can.

These single sentences may be accurate for most but the context they are given is super important. People need to learn how to use dissociation in a health manner to learn about themselves and their condition. Most people are fully strapped to their ego when they first seek help for pain. It's asking a lot of chronic pain patients to learn and change. Especially when most people don't seem to Have to do that in their life or until they get older, 50+                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
1297  3 HCPain    Many of the statements that are condescending might be permissible with context. Practitioners who identify a psychological component contributing to a patient's chronic pain must then offer an intervention, or they are doing harm. Many practitioners use this to justify their lack of action.
