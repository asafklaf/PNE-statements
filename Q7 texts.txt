99   -1.0      1 patients  This is truly confusing. But I'll be honest, pain patients never respond well to the word "addicted." It gives the impression that we are being told we are merely drug seeking addicts, period. The process involved in exactly how the brain works in cases of chronic pain needs to really be explained in depth, preferably without the word "addicted," even if correct from a neurological standpoint when it comes to how the brain functions.

126  -1.0      0 controls  addicted seems a bit extreme. but I w Ould  say they are intertwined. pain is necessary in order for the brain to want the organism that it is danger. therefore the brain is always looking out  for anything that may be  indicative of pain (checking the steady state constantly)

171   0.0      1 patients  I am not sure as to what may lead to the insight that the brain is functionally addicted to pain. I have yet to read more about this. But personally speaking, having experienced chronic pain for over a year, it has been a constant cause of unhappiness with me not being unable to enjoy things that i would normally do. Thus, I have been seeking treatment for me to be painfree.

199   1.0      1 patients  Psychologically, you can fall into a depressive pattern that is influenced by pain. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help accept and overcome pain by re programming how the brain processes pain. Some people become addicted to pain if they become depressed and can't escape through behavior therapy or pain management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
204  -1.0      1 patients  There is already stigma around addiction, I think it would probably be best to not use terminology like this with patients.

217  -1.0      1 patients  I could see why.. if you experience pain a lot, you begin to get used to it and rely on it being there? Anyway I disregard this talk of 'the brain' as an autonomous entity outside of my own body. This does not capture the everyday understandings of patients as themselves as whole persons. I hold phenomenology to a high regard.

235   0.0      1 patients  Whether true or not this does nothing but recentre the "responsibility" of pain on to the sufferer.

238  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  This would be a very problematic statement when used with my clients, I think. The word addiction has a lot of negative connotations in my culture, I think most people would be affronted by this comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
239  -1.0      1 patients  This makes me feel like my pain is my fault.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
241   0.0      1 patients  I would want to know more about this concept.  It sounds plausible but dangerous, like the next step is to expose me to even more painful situations to test this theory.

266  -1.0      1 patients  Brain is such a underdetermined word, hard to grasp what you mean.

346  -1.0      3 HCPain    "Addict" has a really, really bad connotation, especially in the treatment (or rather refusal to do so) of chronic pain. Avoid that.  It's also not a clear statement. What's that supposed to mean? "In chronic pain patients the brain changes to where it relies on the stress response triggered by pain to function" or some such description would have more content and less social dynamite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
347  -1.0      1 patients  Those in chronic, long term pain, want nothing kore this to live normal existence without something stopping them, if it was an addiction, I'd take whatever therapy or treatment to kick that "addiction".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
355  -1.0      3 HCPain    I'm a nurse. With injuries. I think this is a very condescending way of looking at this.

360  -1.0      1 patients  Addiction would imply that you gain a positive feeling from the experience, like chasing a high or escaping reality, which is the opposite with pain.

371  -1.0      1 patients  I understand that the brain can be conditioned to the biological counter measures the body produces. This is why some people can struggle with self destructive behaviour.  However the statement reads like all brains love pain and can't function without it. This is the opposite to my experience, I function better without the pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
373  -1.0      3 HCPain    This statement is unclear. What does functionally mean in this context? (I know, but a layperson may not). Likening it to addiction is unhelpful and insulting. Potentially blaming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
375  -1.0      1 patients  People with chronic pain are often brave masters at tuning out to our pain, we have to be.   We can turn a grimace into a smile for the comfort of those around us...Yet when we turn up to doctors and hospitals, silently screaming in agony...we're told our brains are weak because our emotions are unruly, therefore we just think we're in pain.   It's dehumanising.

400  -1.0      1 patients  I feel many people view "addiction" as a failure and would therefore feel that they are being judged                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
403   0.0      1 patients  I could see this possibly being true as the body does release natural pain killers in response to pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
405  -1.0      1 patients  I don't understand how it can be an addiction, I do believe subconsciously being ill or in pain can give people the nurture aspect that they have lacked in life. However I don't believe it to be true for everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
406  -1.0      1 patients  As an educated person, I've never heard of the Brian being addicted to pain. So even for me this is extremely confusing.  This need further explanation with sources to warrant any credibility.

419  -1.0      1 patients  I don't see the point of this statement. Maybe it's saying that the brain is addicted to the endorphins released when we feel pain? That would be a correct statement technically. However, nobody likes to be in pain, nor do we crave pain.

423   1.0      1 patients  I think everyone depends on some sort of pain. Whether it may be emotional or physical is another question.   Appreciation of life and everything beautiful about it is only possible when you are aware how bad it can be at times. And for that your brain needs a constant reminder of pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
425  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  I don't think this is a helpful explanation in any context. No one likes to hear that they are addicted to anything, much less the endogenous opioids in the CNS.

441   0.0      1 patients  I can conceptualize this but it doesn't matter at the end of the day because the pain is still real. Particularly when broken bones are visible and tendons and ligaments are ripped and require surgery after surgery which obviously cause pain it's useless to conclude that the body is addicted to the feeling when there's always another surgery on the horizon.

458  -1.0      1 patients  This statement makes me feel blamed for feeling pain. I would be very upset at any suggestion the best way to feel better is to simply decide to feel better. This is an attitude I have faced with mental health and has always lead to more self-blame, slower recovery or relapse, and generally worse outcomes.

502   1.0      1 patients  This could be true. But I don't know how to unhook my brain from my pain. Also I'm not already in pain. When my body is in alignment I'm fine. Maybe this is for people who have pain with no known cause? I'm okay for long periods and then I have flares when I'm weak and go out of alignment.

508   0.0      1 patients  The statement is highly dependent on the individual situation, condition, and relationship to the medical practitioner. In some cases the individual can be "addicted" to the hormones and social impacts of being in chronic pain and in some cases, this could be used as a tool of dismissal of pain.

It's still not very helpful unless we're supposed to just accept that pain is there which is kind of what I have done. I'd like to feel a bit better to be more functional (and more similar to healthy pain free people) but it's just going to be there.

529  -1.0      1 patients  This is not true. Many people go through life never experiencing pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
530  -1.0      1 patients  I think the brain tries to keep everything normalized. I do not understand how my body would try to put itself into overdrive as a functional addiction. When my pain is so bad, my brain tells me to buckle up or fling myself off the balcony.  As far as my own self-awareness, I'd much rather not be in pain. Some people like the attention or to be cared for by others.

535   0.0      2 HCNoPain  But confusing because I don't want to be in pain so how can my brain become addicted to it.

540   0.0      1 patients  While it is true, it can come off as poor to those with chronic pain. Pain is used as a way to sense danger and people with chronic pain would have died out in the past. However, with advances people can survive with disabilities, but this says nothing about how to deal with them.

Chronic pain patients often have a higher pain tolerance in general because they put up with a lot of pain in their day to day life.

Especially in America addicts are treated horribly and seen as getting what they deserve when they suffer and hurt. In America addiction is still seen as a choice.

I would also like to see research backing this claim, as it seems a bold one and as with the previous question, #14, implies a victim mentality or drug seeking behavior related to the pain sufferer which again is not helpful for those seeking help.

Find a better term than "addicted" to convey your meaning if you want to go there.

772  -1.0      0 controls  I am curious on more information when I read this statement. In what way do you mean the brain is addicted to pain? Addiction also has such an incredible stigma, and is often seen in relation to substances or behavior. Is it specific kinds of pain? Does the brain release dopamine when the individuals feel pain? The statement alone with no further context, to me, is confusing.

780  -1.0      1 patients  It would be easier to say I'm addicted to this pain than trying to fix it for so long with little to no results. If I was addicted than there would be easier options, but I'm not. I am addicted to sugar and this is a totally different feeling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
794  -1.0      1 patients  That is just a plain uneducated statement. In some circumstances, I think you could be addicted to pain but the type of pain varies and probably has some crossover into the pleasure receptors as well. Certain types of self-harm and sexual fetishes could be an example of this.  I think the brain is more wired to be addicted, used as a loose term, to pleasure and pleasurable things. Working out could be an example of this. To an extent when done in extremes it can be painful. The result of feeling better, healthier, stronger, and more attractive is a pleasure response though that would override the small amount of pain response while exercising.

821  -1.0      1 patients  Pain serves an obvious function for self protection. While it does release endorphins, which can be addictive, to say that pain is functionally addictive is a good oversimplification

837   0.0      3 HCPain    This may be true, but in speaking to Pts the word "addiction" often comes with negative connotations. I'd explain it as a feedback loop- as you experience more pain, your body experiences pain more easily. As a result, the threshold for pain lowers, and it becomes easier to experience more pain all together.

873  -1.0      1 patients  This sucks. People equate themselves to their brains, and "addict" is a loaded word, and so there's this feeling that the doctor might think the patient is an addict. Plus, I don't know what this statement is meant to convey. It's not comparable to any addictions I know of. The feeling of pain dissipates quickly after a stubbed toe or a papercut and nobody attempts to repeat the experience. Pain patients work to avoid pain. Useless and confusing.

Although the exact cause of my pain wasn't always clear in the moment, I or my doctors have almost always been able to identify the injury in hindsight.   This statement implies that the brain is seeking to feel pain where none exists, or that pain is a faulty neurological process rather than a response to real tissue damage.

916  -1.0      1 patients  Even if this was the case (I haven't read anything for or against) the statement doesn't really have any relevance to the experience of pain and you could argue that the brain is functionally addicted to almost any other sensation or experience.

931  -1.0      1 patients  When you've been in pain a long time, it does become part of you, but there's not a chronic pain patient alive that wouldn't give it up in a heartbeat to be pain free.

944   0.0      1 patients  I have no evidence to support or refute this statement. I think it's possible to enter a state of chronic hypervigilance and that in itself could exacerbate the amount of attention a person pays their pain, but I wouldn't term that unfortunate state of affairs an addiction.

954  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  That's just ridiculous. If we truly understood the nature of addiction we would never use this statement. I think it's shaming. It's used by professionals to describe what they think they are seeing happen physiologically in the brain, but reduces a person to be considered an addict?

968   0.0      3 HCPain    I don't think a brain can be addicted to pain. That is like saying you could be addicted to thirst.

973  -1.0      1 patients  I don't know what this means, unless you are talking about a psychological disability someone has.  Can someone imagine that they are always in pain,  I have read, though, that doctors who can not diagnose a patients pain, give up and tell the patient that it is all in their head. ( to protect their egos that they do not have all the answers) later to find out fron another doector that this person has a rare disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
974  -1.0      3 HCPain    To be addicted to something you need to get something out of it. This statement has my blood boiling right now. I used to be addicted to the mental high I would get from running.

Strengthening of neural networks, ie learning, is a helpful concept, and perhaps "functional addiction" might help healthcare reduce its unhelpful focus on patients malingering, however I don't see how this statement is useful to be given to a patient

1020 -1.0      1 patients  It seems as many may be addicted to pleasure and adverse to pain. It implies that it is an individual's choice to be emotionally and physically abused, that they intentionally look for opportunities to suffer injury, and it is their fault that they suffer pain.

1034  0.0      1 patients  I understand the basis behind this because of the theory of addiction. I have also understood that my pain doctor and I have had to switch meds before in order to "confuse" my brain or "retrain" it when I've been on a pain med that has worked for a long time and has just stopped working for absolutely no reason - so, I'm going to kind of assume that this would fall under this type of thing, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
1036 -1.0      1 patients  I think addiction is the wrong word. And addition has so many negative connotations. I think saying that the part of the brain that responds to painful stimuli becomes over excited and doesn't shut down is far more helpful. Addiction seems to also imply that we are complicit in our pain.

1064 -1.0      1 patients  There's a lot of discussion in the chronic pain community about the difference between "physically dependent" and "addicted."  That's a distinction without a difference to the DEA, opioid policymakers, and overzealous pharmacists.  Here in the US addiction is treated as a criminal problem, not a psychological or social issue. I think using addicted in this statement is going to get pushback from pain patients trying to differentiate themselves from recreational or street level users.

1112 -1.0      3 HCPain    What does this mean? Does it mean something like "the inner-workers of the brain require occasional pain as an input to properly calibrate sensory response" or something? If so, provide more information. Alternatively, it could easily come across as a condescending statement as a justification to not provide pain management. "You've decided to be in pain" or some other nonesense.

1206  0.0      0 controls  Intriguing. Is this supposed to mean that pain can satisfy a psychological need and one can get addicted to it? Which seems intuitive as cutting is a thing. Or does it say that all brains are addicted to pain - in which way? All sensory input is "pain" in a way, but usually we only identify unpleasant input above a certain threshold as "pain". I don't see another interpretation right now.

Or is it addiction in layman's term where it can't seem to stop sending pain signal?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
1233  1.0      1 patients  I'm curious about what this means but definitely understand the concept. Especially when the pain gets intertwined with depression,  addiction to medication,  etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
1234  1.0      1 patients  The word "addiction" implies that the same brain structures and pathways involved in drug addiction are also involved in pain perception. I've never heard of that, but it sounds wrong. Maybe it's just supposed to emphasize how much the conscious mind is innately drawn to focus on pain much all else.

1277 -1.0      2 HCNoPain  Addiction is too vague and ambiguous term, and I'm not aware of any tolerance building or withdrawal symptoms one would have in regards to pain. Addiction means too many things to different people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
1278 -1.0      1 patients  This depends heavily on context. If the doctor says this in good faith, and he walks me through an explanation of the biological and chemical reasons behind it, then that's completely acceptable. I would be confused at first, but I wouldn't be upset. If this came up in a discussion about legally prescribed opioids, I would have some serious problems. I've been called a junkie to my face before by a healthcare professional. I'm extremely proud of the fact that I've broken every serious vice I've ever had, the main three being caffeine, alcohol, and cigarettes. At the same time, a family member of mine, a paranoid schizophrenic, has been addicted to heroin for over two decades. I've seen the truly evil, violent actions of someone who has entirely lost their humanity to addiction. As you can imagine, being called an addict in any sense produces a very visceral response of anger on my part.
