77    1.0      2 HCNoPain  Helpful to a point. However I have found it being used to avoid having to take note of the palpatory findings of experienced osteopaths who can evaluate somatic dysfunction, if present, as a component of the chronic pain mechanism. Critics of this statement are always people who do not have that degree of trained palpatory awareness, and resort to inadequate and faulty research to attempt to prove that osteopaths can't do what we do.

99   -1.0      1 patients  While true in the case of a hot stove or walking barefoot on glass, it does nothing to address the fact that pain, especially chronic pain, is often nonsensical. There can often be no rhyme or reason to it in respect to when pain is severe relative to when it is tolerable. My condition is the same in either case. For arguments sake, let's say that an hour ago I was relatively pain free and now the pain is overwhelming. Perhaps an hour ago I could walk around easily, now pain leaves me limping. My physical and medical condition during that time period is entirely unchanged but my pain level has risen nonetheless. An hour ago, my body did not conclude that I was threatened or in danger, but now all of a sudden, it does? This is an utterly useless statement in trying to relate or connect with a pain patient on either an intellectual or emotional level. It will be summarily rejected, because who can realistically answer in an understandable and quantifiable way why my brain has now suddenly decided that I am threatened and in danger? Like I said, it is illogical and thus is completely useless. If you try to speak to a pain patient with this statement, you will lose them.

In my opinion, the content of treatment has more weight.

123  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  The brain is an instrument - it is still not clear what "thinks"and "concludes" in our lives, but definitely not the brain itself. This is an oversimplification; I'd suggest to place a phenomenological perspective at first place: a person has the experience of pain and related constructs; this experience is reflected in physiological processes, including the brain. It may happen, that the action system, which is under the control of brain functions, may react automatically to protect a person (fight, flight, freeze) - then relate it to amugdala and other brain functions (f this is suitable for a patient's education....).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
126  -1.0      0 controls  The subconscious part of the statement makes me undecided only because in the previous questions I've stated that the individual should be aware of the tissue damage or not in order to perceive it. this is not an absolute statement but when the adrenaline is pumping and you're enduring tissue damage, the priority would be to get to safety rather than tend the painful wound. Chronic pain is  difficult because a lot of the times there is no known trigger (fibromyalgia). While other times there can be a cranial nerve being compressed thats triggering the trigeminal neuralgia pain you've been having for the past 7 months.

199   0.0      1 patients  To some, this may be the case. But not to all. I don't know about the brain deciding that, because you're in pain you must be in danger. I believe that you're in pain because you're injured. Why make it more complicated than that?

216  -1.0      1 patients  I had drs tell me my debilitating pain was all in my head. Took 8 years to get diagnosed with RA. I was told I was making it up. No one chooses to be in pain. I damn sure didn't do it for the inadequate pain meds they didn't want to give me. No one jumps thru the hoops of pain specialists. Pays thousands out of pocket & has to quit their job on purpose cuz its all in their head. Pain is a cunt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
217   0.0      1 patients  Okay. True but this is also the case for anxiety. Chronic pain hurts because it's hurts.

227  -1.0      1 patients  This just means the doctors don't know what's wrong with me and can't be bothered looking further                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
233   0.0      1 patients  I have seen MRI and was shown where nerve damage is,it is very clear and obvious even to a non medical person like myself.Nothing even close to the nerve yet i have intense pain,i am fearful of any known things  know make matters worse,for instance long car journeys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
235  -1.0      1 patients  It's too wishy washy. "For some reason or another" doesn't really sound like it's coming from a place of knowledge. It just sounds like junk science                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
236  -1.0      1 patients  Sounds like a theory that doesn't help me in any way. I perceive my perception of stimuli, my body and its movement, feeling etc as heightened and more sensitive than the average person. Would not consider chronic pain from a threat or danger as much as a warning.

262  -1.0      1 patients  I know this to be true from my personal experience with fibromyalgia, but many people won't be able to see it that way because of their personal history with chronic pain. I also think that "that you are threatened or in danger" is a bit too vague and implies that the source of the danger is external to you, when it can be internal (that is to say, something you are currently doing).

298  -1.0      0 controls  This is wrong. To even think this would be ok to say to a chronic pain sufferer shows a complete lack of understanding about how debilitating and real their pain is. Just because you can't find a real cause doesn't mean there isn't one. EDS sufferers are often misdiagnosed or not believed, but their pain is significant and real, caused by real tissue and nerve damage, and is not some psychosomatic bs.

311  -1.0      1 patients  No I think chronic pain exists because there's some local chemical kindling effect with sensory neutrons that's self perpetuating, or, nerve fibers have been damaged, or, the source of the pain has not been found and addressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
313  -1.0      1 patients  this is accurate for some types of chronic pain but not all.

For a patient, if the information is not actionable, it often seems frustrating to hear.  However, if there was a way to prevent that subconscious feeling, which would then help the pain, then it wouldn't be useless.

320   0.0      3 HCPain    This sounds logical, but in all honesty, as a woman, it sounds like a fancier way of saying your emotional and that is why this is happening.

328  -1.0      1 patients  This sounds like someone is trying to degrade a person's experiences with chronic pain. This statement could also be extremely detrimental to the chronic pain community as it gives people yet another reason to doubt the reality/severity of someones condition.

343  -1.0      1 patients  Obviously pain is a signal from the brain. There is a lot we don't know about how the body works, and a lack of visible damage can be due to incorrect tests, an invalid reading, just as much as it can be psychosomatic. Presuming pain is psychosomatic isn't helpful to anyone.

If I know what the subconscious is then I probably also know that when something harms us physically it causes pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
346  -1.0      3 HCPain    "OFTEN completely subconsciously"? That implies people sometimes consciously choose to be in chronic pain or feel threatened. I have yet to see an example of that.  "Threatened and in danger" generally evokes the picture of external factors, but chronic pain is an internal problem. Chronic pain patients are often afraid of their pain, making it worse, but somehow that doesn't fit the statement. Not useful, too wishy-washy.

357  -1.0      1 patients  Absence of evidence becomes evidence of absence. Someone somehow concluded chronic pain is the result of the subconscious mind. This logic and absence of evidence has warranted locking women up for centuries in psych wards, while the notion and those actions in themselves is what's out of touch with reality.

364   0.0      1 patients  There is good info in this statement but it is surrounded by unnecessary words that do not really add to the overall point. It would make more sense if everything between the first and last comma were erased. Also "chronic pain hurts" sounds weird. It makes it sound like chronic pain causes hurting when chronic pain is synonymous with hurting, not really a cause and effect relationship.

I would avoid using this with patients who have identifiable reasons for their pain (eds, spinal cord injury, arthritis etc).

384  -1.0      1 patients  I had thought that it was the other way around... That persistent pain triggers the threat system, making us more sensitive to future pain. As an EDS patient my frequent injuries cause pain and I guess my threat system is always engaged waiting for the next event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
385  -1.0      1 patients  My experience with pain is the result of physical damage to my body and has nothing to do with this sort of psychological state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
387  -1.0      1 patients  This sounds like you're making chronic pain into psychosymptomatic pain. It's not that, it's not caused by anxiety.

421  -1.0      1 patients  "In danger" seems dramatic. I have plantar fasciitis because of poor running form and bad footwear. My brain is trying to tel me to fix those thingsâ€”not that I'm somehow in danger.

423  -1.0      1 patients  Chronic pain can, but most certainly doesn't have to be something your brain has â€žconcluded". This wording once again makes it sound like something made up. Especially with scientifically proven underlying issues that can cause chronic pain, calling it â€žconcluded by your brain" takes away from the factual medical issue.

Most chronic pain is indeed because of a process of the brain amplifying or creating a pain signal, but the chronic pain created by inflammatory diseases is (for example) also caused by a biological process.

448  -1.0      1 patients  I think that statement is rude and there is data to suggest otherwise                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
449  -1.0      3 HCPain    This could be true if no physical manifestation presented later. Example, someone with a high ACE score developing an auto immune disease in response to childhood trama. As an adult they could be removed from the situation and feeling better mentally, but the body now has physical damage due to prolonged stress responses. So now it is actual physical pain and not just subconscious pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
456  -1.0      3 HCPain    This is just incorrect for me, and I would consider a doctor to be very uninformed about my conditions if this was said. I'm in pain because my joints dislocate around 5 times per day, it has nothing to do with my brain perceiving danger.

480  -1.0      1 patients  Not helpful, or even entirely accurate. For old injuries and possibly syndromes such as fibromyalgia, this is true, but in EDS, there often is tissue damage from the hypermobility, in IBS, the pain comes from cramping, some theories suggest migraines are caused by the blood vessels in the brain tightening. Some chronic pain is caused by a confused brain, and these patients should be treated with respect and dignity, however, many of us have something tangible and provable happening in our bodies to cause the pain and this cannot be treated in the same way as other chronic pain conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
481  -1.0      1 patients  what this is saying is that the pain I am feeling is most likely psychosomatic and that if I worked on my mental perception of my problem it would go away. Well my knee sliding out of place when I walk up stairs and it swelling up for days doesn't seem very psychosomatic. Again I understand there are other conditions then mine on the list but if you asked this to someone with EDS they would be upset.

494  -1.0      1 patients  To someone in chronic pain, unless they have a working diagnosis this statement is more confusing than helpful.

508  -1.0      1 patients  I think this is entirely dependent on the underlying condition. Disorders causing pain may or may not perceive an underlying threat. In the case of autoimmune disorders, the brain has not subconsciously made a decision, it is a physical response. The same can be said in most,if not all, other physical disorders and I cannot comment on the psychological.

514  -1.0      1 patients  Part of the reason I would not like to be told this is it's either completely untrue or EXTREMELY oversimplified, I guess depending how you read it. I can understand what's happening in my body especially if it's explained to me, so just explain it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
520  -1.0      1 patients  There is a tendency to reduce the experience of pain to psychological elements and the effect is often to say that what is causing the pain is untreatable and that the doctor will not try to help me improve my life. It shows a lack of empathy.

It leads people to think the problem is with the way that they are thinking, rather than look for the real cause of their pain.

The hormones your brain and glands produce adjust to keep your body in homeostasis or otherwise run smoothly. It has to accommodate for changes with positive and negative feedback. When it happens every day, it makes sense that your brain starts a "new normal."  There is sometimes awareness of fight or flight when the pain is so bad, but I think that's different.  The confusing part is how to get your brain to return to normal.

If your joints keep dislocating with EDS, it's not your brain's protection causing the pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
541  -1.0      1 patients  It makes it seem like people with chronic pain can control their pain by just finding out what wrong mentally.

A dangerously dismissive statement that basically tells people they need psychiatric help instead of specific care for their pain.

549  -1.0      1 patients  I have to do a lot of extrapolating to see any use in this sentence, e.g.: "I sense pain in my back because my Ankylosing Spondylitis is causing inflammation and trying to fuse my spine together. This makes some part of my brain indicate this area needs attention because in a fight-or-flight situation I may not be able to rely on this area of my body." Even when I make this tenuous connection there are other vagaries ("for some reason or another" and I am ultimately not provided any relief or information that would lead to me feeling better.

564  -1.0      1 patients  Chronic pain, if it's NEUROLOGICAL IN NATURE, can have that effect. It's also not subconscious, just going by what's taught about chronic pain conditions in neuroscience via university. Is it inflammatory? If it is, then it's obviously not solely neurological in nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
565  -1.0      1 patients  I have pain 100% of the time.  In very rare situations do i ever feel threatened or in danger.  Most of the time when i feel those responses, it isn't due to my pain.

574  -1.0      1 patients  Doesn't your body think it's in danger if it's in pain? Most of us had read about the mind body connection. We have also been told by doctors that it's all in our heads by docs using this mind body connection. Yes we understand. This is usually what doctors say right before they say they can't help us. We just want doctors to at least try to help us.

577  -1.0      1 patients  My chronic pain is because of chronically acute dislocations and the nerve damage caused by said dislocations throughout my life.

My sciatic pain is caused by an irritated nerve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
639  -1.0      1 patients  Yeah, has nothing to do with my immune system causing my spine to fuse at all.   I think pain can be psychosomatic, but it's dangerous to group all chronic pain in that way.

643   0.0      0 controls  I'd want evidence. It doesn't seem to fit my situation, and I was able to resolve my chronic pain eventually. Solving it didn't involve convincing my subconscious brain that I wasn't in danger. Maybe my experience is abnormal - but I'd want to see the data that shows this statement to be true

662  -1.0      1 patients  This implies that the brain is creating the pain rather than communicating the pain. While it is true that the reason for the sensation of pain to exist is for the brain to tell your body that you are in danger, by adding descriptors such as "subconsciously" and "somehow" and focusing on chronic pain, it implies that the pain is not real. However, this sort of chronic pain is not accurate except in a small handful of pain conditions which are forms of mental illness. Others are caused by actual constant physical trauma, or by the pain receptors being broken so much that they sense that trauma even when it is no longer there or not as severe.

Or if i feel pain i think that i was injured again

677  -1.0      1 patients  This statement is undermining the reality that chronic pain patients face. Think about this next time you stub your toe and feel that sharp jab of pain radiating up your body.  Imagine it is permanent and you will feel it forever. And maybe not just in your toe but shooting up half your body or even all of it.  You are going to feel that forever.  Now I can give you medication that will make 80-95 of that pain away. But you will have to fight for it and go to the doctor every month and face people treating you like an addict. But guess what you will do all those things.  Because can you imagine falling asleep with that pain or working 8 hours and coming home and cleaning and taking care of kids and some asshole doctor telling you that the pain is just unpleasant? An invention of your brain?

685  -1.0      1 patients  I think this is only applicable in some situations and it also makes it sound like I am expected to think away the pain, but in a less condescending way.

However it seems to imply that this is the only source of chronic pain, so I would prefer to also have factors like posture/diet/lifestyle brought to mind

739  -1.0      3 HCPain    It doesn't ring true. Chronic pain is again a response. The brain in responding to a perceived injury. A stress response would be an activity of the brain/body to a perception of danger. Western society lives in a stressed environment by and large but that isn't due to pain it is environmental/situational.

751  -1.0      1 patients  My conscience mind knows I'm not in danger or threatened yet it still sends signals to be in pain. This has to be one of the most useless statements that I've ever seen. It has no regard for people actually suffering pain despite being in a safe space. This would be insulting to read and is completely demeaning to anyone who suffers from long term pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
753   1.0      2 HCNoPain  It may be a good way to describe to patients why they may be in pain, even though the local tissue injury has healed/ resolved.

774   0.0      1 patients  I think the "somehow" could come off poorly, depending on the person. It may depend on if this was being read or verbally spoken. Just reading it, it sounded like it was possibly implying that your brain is being ridiculous. Which may be true but people tend to associate there brain with who they are, which could lead to a negative response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
775   1.0      0 controls  This makes me want to learn more, because it must be stressful for the body to constantly think it is threatened and in danger.

780  -1.0      1 patients  Maybe for some people. My pain is more complex than a cut/broken arm that is potentially putting me in danger. My pain does not seem to have a pattern. Stress manifested in clenching can start to bring out the pain, but that is extreme. I do experience small amounts of pain every day where I am not experiencing a threatened or dangerous feeling, however maybe I don't know. I have also learned to avoid the situations which cause large amounts of pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
787   0.0      1 patients  The sentence is a bit convoluted (too long), my suggestion would be:   Chronic pain hurts because the brain has concluded, often completely subconsciously, that you are threatened and in danger

805  -1.0      1 patients  Most pain can be attributed to diseased or dysfunctional anatomy so it seems like your brain thinking you are in danger could cause pain, but I doubt it causes most pain.

837  -1.0      3 HCPain    I think a better way to put this would be to say that pain is a tool. In its essence, pain is an alarm system to tell us that something is wrong with the body. But sometimes the alarm goes off even when there's nothing wrong- or the alarm system becomes more sensitized the more it goes off. The pain may not represent a true threat, but that doesn't change the fact that the alarm is going off.

847   1.0      1 patients  I think this is true.  Like I mentioned above, the brain creates its own narrative and makes you think that you will feel pain by expecting the pain.  I experience pain because my body feels like it's in danger and it needs to protect itself.

861   1.0      1 patients  It makes complete sense to me, and I'm interested in further advances in the understanding of neurology that will explain my conditions and hopefully lead to some solution. I am also diagnosed with PTSD, general anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and major depression. I'm fully convinced that my brain is not operating like it should, and I see no reason that chronic pain wouldn't, likewise, be the result of a neurological problem. All these things might be interrelated.

868  -1.0      0 controls  Does being threatened or being in danger inflict pain? I think that subconsciously feeling threatened would more likely be the source of general anxiety disorder (or some other kind of anxiety/stress disorders).

And doesn't pain also exist when something is "wrong" or at least not the way it should be, rather than only threats and danger?

I think if a doctor said this to me, I would be expecting to be sold bullshit next or told my pain isn't real or worth treating. It's a statement that feels good, like it wraps up the cause of pain in a neat bow, but forebodes a useless treatment experience.

902  -1.0      1 patients  This reads like an oversimplification of the causes of chronic pain. Some chronic pain, like in Ehlers Danlos Syndrome or Rheumatoid Arthritis, arises from constant tissue damage. The causes of still other chronic pain, like in Fibromyalgia or Migraine, are not well understood. To characterize that pain as "subconscious conclusions" of the brain is making an unscientific leap.

916  -1.0      1 patients  Just simply doesn't seem to be the case, my pain is brought about by signals sent down my spinal cord that then malfunction due to interaction with nonconductive/poorly conductive leison sites. My brain hasn't decided I am in danger, and this places a psychological and emotional reading on what is essentially an error code flung up by broken connectors.

973   1.0      1 patients  Interesting.  So are you saying that because my ankle has a bad injury, my brain tells me it hurts, so I will not continue to use it in a way that would damage it further.  I like that idea. So maybe pain relievers that are constantly taken only mask the problem instead of forcing you to take action to heal the injury.. ( notice I said constant)  so tell me, how dos this theory work for migraines?  I have friends that have had constant migraines for decades and the docs can't help or fix the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
974   0.0      3 HCPain    I think that is true but a lot of education must be done for the patient to truly understand all the inner workings of that and not find that offensive or understand that in a way that just somehow means that they're broken.

981   1.0      2 HCNoPain  I find this statement informative and hopefully helpful. However, from having lived with CP, I can see how this would be taken as condescending if you felt your pain experience was not being validated, especially if your previous experience with HCP's led you to believe that the cause of your pain was structural.

985  -1.0      2 HCNoPain  Could be helpful but said alone without additional information specific to the person with chronic pain, it sounds like the brain is trying to trick the person.

However it can be dismissive and suggesting that "their brain is wrong" if not communicated or understood as intended

1018 -1.0      1 patients  Pain is interpreted in the primitive parts of the brain, which does not do "conclusions". There is no relevant distinction between acute and chronic pain, they feel the same. No one feels "threatened" or "in danger" from a headache even though they are in pain (with no actual tissue damage).  Such notions are, quite frankly, pure woo.

1036  0.0      1 patients  Helpful because it explains pain, when the injury or surgery has healed. Confusing because sometimes, pain increases when I am happy, not at all concerned, in a positive frame of mind & sometimes it becomes severe when I am peacefully sleeping.

1041 -1.0      1 patients  I do not think it to be true. Many times chronic pain has no root in being threatened or in danger. Many times it's a dysfunctional body sending signals to the nerves, then to your brain because of how this body is built. It can be the way you were born, or the way you're physically.

Sometimes, the brain causes chronic pain because it thinks there's a threat or danger, often without your input."

1060 -1.0      1 patients  I feel that pain directly after an injury (ex broken bone) can be dramatically lessened as a result of the subconscious feeling threatened, due to shock. Every single time I have broken a bone, there's a moment where I feel the "crack", but for the first few hours, it's just a slight ache. I can tell when I go into shock because I always get very cold and start shivering, even in the Alabama summers. It's almost as if when the body is first responding to the pain (atleast in my case), it goes into shock as a way to control the pain, as a response to a "threat". Perhaps the pain is lessened immediately after because the body feels we may need to have the ability to "run away" from that perceived threat, and couldn't do so if our brain was allowing us to experience the full spectrum of pain immediately after the injury                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
1063  1.0      3 HCPain    I like this statement, but also realize its limitation since some people have a chronic state of inflammation that can drive nociceptive pain states.

1078 -1.0      3 HCPain    All of these statements are entirely useless for the general population. The language is poorly chosen, the statements are theoretical. They don't even suggest a practical application.  No-one considers their pain in these terms.

We know that there are some conditions, such as nerve impingement or similar, which are both chronic and which can cause pain directly. This statement may be able to incorporate such cases, but if so, it brings a lot of emotional baggage along with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
1113 -1.0      1 patients  The chronic pain I feel from both arachnoiditis and serial joint dislocation/subluxation, I'd argue, is hardly a figment of my imagination. I'll happily pull a doctor's arm out of socket a few times and see if they still agree with the above statement.

1234 -1.0      1 patients  It's not really clear what they're trying to say here. I've heard something like this statement before said more concisely... I think its saying that pain exists to warn you that you are in danger. Chronic pain does not alert you to any new developments that need to be addressed and is only a hindrance in life.

1288 -1.0      1 patients  So when a joint sublux while working, or a knee buckles, or my back slips because of hypermobility the only reason I feel pain is because my brain thinks I'm in danger? Bull shit.  If this is sincerely accurate and fresh science tells us this is true then I don't have chronic pain according to medicine. I have ehlers danlos syndrome which is characterized as shit collagen resulting in crappy connective tissue which is easily damaged.

1300 -1.0      3 HCPain    The hedge words "somehow", "for some reason or another" sound dismissive.

1306 -1.0      2 HCNoPain  Chronic pain is often due to sensitization of the nervous system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
1307  1.0      1 patients  If I didn't know about the cycle of pain stimulating the sympathetic nervous system, leading to heightened sensitivity, which leads to more pain and so on I would probably find this condescending, but my pain specialist who uses cognitive behavioral therapy for his pain patients helped me understand this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
1314 -1.0      1 patients  "Somehow" seems to imply that the brains conclusion is perceived rather than real. Many people with chronic pain have real injuries that their bodies are trying to draw attention to. The word "somehow" makes it seem as though the person is not in danger.
